"I don't think we should automatically register people who are eligible to vote in the United States. It has always been a choice to become a registered voter and and our civic duty to participate in elections. Those who do not register themselves are likely people who don't care about their civic duty and clearly have no sense of loyalty to this country. I think those people should be left as unregistered, instead of making everyone registered and some simply don't vote. I think it should be public knowledge if a person is not registered to vote. If I were a small business owner and looking to hire an employee, I would not consider an applicant who has chosen not to register to vote.",1,control,vote,1
"I am opposed to automatic voter registration because it will open the door to more cheating and widespread voter fraud.  I am skeptical that every election will be legitimately conducted fairly.  The left had already cheated in5 the 2020 Presidential election and with automatic voter registration will just add another form of cheating that the Left can do.  I think this is why they are letting in all these people past the border illegally.  Aside from fearing voter fraud, there is also my concern over privacy.  I am worried about hoew the government will handle and potentially mishandle everyon9533e's date.",1,control,vote,1
I don't believe there should be a ban on semi-automatic rifles because all Americans should have the right to purchase any type of gun that they choose. There shouldn't be a limit as to what they can buy. There are many gun enthusiasts that use guns appropriately and do not cause any harm to other humans. Just because there are people in the world that harm others with guns it doesn't mean everyone has to suffer. People kill others with cars and driving unfer the influence of alcohol but cars and alcohol aren't being banned. So why shouldn't the same rules apply to guns? Let Americans make their own decisions without government intervention.,1,control,gun,1
"Student debt should not be funded by the government. Instead, it would be better if students were incentivized to go to trade schools or community colleges. This not only puts less of a burden on students, but also sets them up for financial success later on. One can make the case that college is starting to become less and less relevant now that automation and AI are taking over most industries. It is the government's responsibility to be transparent about this and let people know what the profitable professions are. Therefore, student debt should not be cancelled. Rather, the priorities should shift.",1,control,loan,1
"I do not believe that the government should be in the business of funding paid parental leave. I believe this because the government currently does not have the tax base to support such a policy. Because there is no tax to cover this, the government would be going into debt - something it has done way too much of. The crushing debt of the US government is essentially passing the buck to future generations who will face the negative consequences of it. This is morally wrong. I think a better solution would be to only fund things if there is a tax for it. The alternative is burdening future generations with debt slavery.",1,control,parent,1
"I do not think that cancelling student debt would be very beneficial in the long run and nor is it fair to the individuals who have had to pay all their debt prior to this.  The best-case scenario would be that student debt is DRASTICALLY cut down; it should not be as expensive as it is to go to school to further education.  It is truthfully a scam with how much it costs, and most families cannot afford it or will be paying their debts for life.  Reducing the cost of education would make the most sense for us Americans and it would be for of a fair outcome for everyone.",1,control,loan,1
"I cannot completely agree with cancelling student debt, there are so many trades and skills you can learn without a college degree. The amount of students who go just to party, or don't meet the level they need to succeed could have been better off doing something more rewarding.

We're losing the skilled tradesmen and laborers that we need to keep this economy afloat. Those students went there knowing the risks and how to deal with it.  We'd end up giving them this expectation that all their debts will be canceled and end up with more expectancies then governed. 

Yes we need Dr's and lawyers and in time their debts will be paid off and they'll move forward like everyone before them. There is grants and assistance to help allocate the costs down. Working hard to earn those should have been their priority instead of taking a chance.",1,control,loan,1

I oppose the US federal government funding paid parental leave. This is just another instance of government overreach. Federal government should be much more limited on the impact that they have on the average Americans life. The founding fathers never meant for them to have this kind of overreach into everyday life. Paid parental leave should be paid for by the employer for the employee. This should not be something that the government pays for. This only causes taxes to go up. I do not want to pay for employees to have paid parental leave. The US government should not be involved in this.,1,control,parent,1
"I am not one hundred percent opposed to allocating some funds to assist some people unable to afford health care.  But, I think it should be on a very limited basis.  Our tax dollars are already spread very thin over many areas that should not be tax funded.  Funding health insurance is socialistic and a huge drain on our funds.  Rather than allocating funds, I think legislation should be presented that truly reforms the insurance health care system, not just throws money at it by funding the same over-inflated costs.  The insurance companies have far too much input into the actual healthcare of an individual and that, rather than funding individuals, is what needs to change.",1,control,health,1
"I don't believe that the government should allocate funds to those who can't fully afford health insurance.  Most jobs now offer health benefits.

We all need to take care of ourselves.  I would be glad to help those that are unable to work, but not those that just choose not to work.  Get a job and work for what you want.   It's pretty simple.  The government funding this would just raise taxes on hard-working Americans.",1,control,health,1

"I feel that every person should have fully funded healthcare. I just don't think that anyone who is employed should rely on the government to provide that assistance. Employers have a responsibility to assist their employees with being able to afford health care by either fully paying for it or contributing a larger amount towards the cost of the care. If the government wants to contribute to ensuring that people can afford their healthcare, they should implement policies that require employers to fully fund health care for all employees. The government should only step in to assist those who are not employed or those that cannot afford healthcare due to not having the resources to pay for such care.",1,control,health,1

My grandson knew he did not want that debt hanging over his head just to say he want to a ""cool"" college.

"The United States has plenty of problems here. We do not need to allocate important funds to fight a proxy war in Europe. It doesn't seem that Ukraine will be able to win the war, so it seems pointless to continue throwing money at a stalemate at best. Ukraine also has not proven itself to be free of corruption, so we shouldn't give money to a government that isn't using the funds provided with its citizens best interest in mind. Funding the Ukrainian war efforts seems less effective that something like economic sanction, which will still hurt Russia while not directly involving the US in the conflict. There is also a chance that US aid to Ukraine could result in an escalation that will eventually involve American troops being deployed in a conflict with Russia.",1,control,ukraine,1

However, I do believe that student debt should have a very low interest rate, because I understand that interest gets a lot of borrowers in trouble.

Institute a program like this, and I guarantee it will be filled with countless identity criteria that focuses on recently discovered underrepresented groups.

"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That is the text of the 2nd Amendment. The people need firearms for self-defense, whether it is to protect their personhood, property, or country. Any restriction of this right defies the Constitutional and God-given right of every American. What would banning semi-automatic rifles accomplish? The government would still have them. Criminals would still have them. The people who need to protect themselves from those two entities would not have them. If you think 'guns' in general are a problem then you don't belong in America and don't understand the world.",1,control,gun,1
"Hello, here are the reasons as to why I'm totally against the banning of semi-automatic assault rifles. Let us start with the basics, the thing that you will hear the most with this type of question. We have the right to own weapons, it's in our rights. Weapons are used to defend ourselves from danger. 

The counter to this fact that democrats normally say is ""Who needs a semi-auto or a fully auto rifle to defend themselves?"" That is indeed a very good question to ask, one that we need to think about deeply. Have you ever wondered where criminals get their guns? How come, that even in countries where guns are banned (like in Japan), there are still criminals who use all sorts of guns, ranging from your standard handguns, mid powered uzis, to high-powered fully automatic assault rifles? They certainly did not buy them legally because those things are banned in Japan. So where did these guns come from? Simple answer - The Black Market.

There are many places in the world, and even the internet (dark web), where you can easily purchase weapons of every caliber. These are usually run by syndicates or organizations that are focused on criminal activity. They have many ""fences"" or places where they sell or trade weapons, and this means that they have connections with local gangs or ""dark web sellers"".

So what happens if criminals can easily obtain these types of powerful weapons, while us normal citizens only have access to the weaker types? What can a handgun, with maybe around 15 rounds, do against high powered weapons like semi or fully automatic assault rifles, that have 30 or so rounds each and can quickly reload? The result is we, the average citizens, become victims. We die, we get violated, our family also gets killed or assaulted sexually, everything we have earned through our hard work gets taken away by these criminals with their high powered weapons.

Next, let's see if our democratic politicians actually practice what they preach about their anti-gun stances. Have you heard of Stacey Arbams, a former democrat Georgia State Representative? In a past public interview, she stated that guns should be banned. But if that's her stance, then why does she have three fully armed bodyguards protecting her at all times? Why do these politicians also own guns themselves if they're saying we shouldn't own guns at all? That's the problem, these anti-gun politicians don't practice what they preach. They keep telling us what we can and cannot have, but it doesn't apply to them. These politicians are hypocrites.

Let's jump to another matter. In an ideal world, we can always rely on our police and military to protect us from criminals and invaders. But let's check out what happens in real life. Imagine you're a woman going home at night, then some thug jumps out of the bushes and he starts threatening you with a knife. He orders you to follow him into the dark alley and to take off all of your clothes. What do you do? Are you just gonna try to run away while calling 911? Can you even successfully call 911 while you're running? Do you even know exactly where you are? How much of a panic are you in right now? You'll probably start shaking and cry and you own't be able to move. This is why it is important for you to own a gun AND have gun training. Gun training doesn't simply mean being able to accurately shoot. It also involves discipline in order to develop your mind to not panic during threatening situations. Gun training also teaches you when it is appropriate to use your gun to defend yourself. With proper gun training, you'll be confident in defending yourself or the people you care about from nasty criminals who want to assault you.

In conclusion, there is no reason to ban semi-auto assault rifles or any type of weapon at all, because the criminals who are trying to victimize us have access to even more powerful weapons. By banning our access to better weapons, we are surrendering to the criminals. It is our right to own weapons and defend ourselves. Do not let the criminals have the upper hand.",1,control,gun,1

"I disagree with the suggested Prohibition of Semi-automatic ""assault-style"" gun sales 


I appreciate the worries about gun violence, but the rights of law-abiding citizens would be unjustly violated by this ban

A cornerstone of American freedom is the Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms. To ban semi-automatics would be to violate this fundamental right if this right is violated what is the next constitutional right to be violated?

Furthermore, assault style is a vague term that frequently relates to flair rather than functionality, and addressing the underlying cause of gun violence would be difficult with such a ban considering research sow that Handguns

"Canceling is not such a great idea. Forgiving some of the funds might be ok, but outright canceling it is a bad idea. It gives the wrong impression that it's ok to default on money owed. I also feel like the universities or learning institutions, in good faith, provided an education or service and expected to, as a business, be paid. I could be wrong, but I doubt a bank will loan you money for a car, and when you decide you no longer are going to pay back the loan they just say, ""No problem, and by the way, just keep the car.""",1,control,loan,1
"Personally, I do not see how banning the sale of these rifles will curb crime in any way. As a matter of fact, crime will probably increase due to the fact if a criminal wants this type of weapon, they will break into houses and business in search of these guns in particular, ones that were sold before the ban. Preventing people from buying or owning any type of weapon, is leave them weak and vulnerable. It amounts to the bad guy knowing that he has the upper hand. There are many ways that criminals, murderers, commit their crimes and I do not support the banning of knives, hammers, screwdrivers or even ""assault=style"" rifles. If a foreign country invades American soil to take over our country, people will be glad that honest, patriotic citizens have those weapons.",1,control,gun,1

"A carbon tax would be recessive in the United States. Fossil Fuels would become more expensive, which would then be a burden on lower-income residents. It would equal paying more of their income for necessities like gas, food, and electricity. It would also raise the cost of manufacturing which would lead to higher product costs in general. Many companies would end up going out of business, like the coal industry and gas industry. In turn, many people will lose jobs as well. The Carbon Tax would also be difficult to implement because it would require accurate measurements and reporting of emissions. I think there would be huge challenges in determining the appropriate price for carbon and then ensuring that it is accurately passed on to consumers.",1,control,carbon,1
"I never had a strong position about the banning/not banning of semi-automatic rifles in the past.  But that all changed one night when neighbors of mine went through a devastating experience.  The husband had been out of town for work, and because of his trips out of town, he made sure his wife knew how to operate their AR15.  It was always properly locked up in their gun safe.  One night, four men broke into their house, waking her and their two children up.  She immediately jumped up and went to the safe to retrieve the gun, which was already loaded.  Just then, two of the men busted through her bedroom door.  They both had guns; one shot at her first, but luckily missed her.  She shot back and hit both the men.  The two remaining men heard the commotion and ran back out the front door.  She immediately ran to the children's room and found they were untouched and okay.  If she had not had protection that night for her and her children, that night would have ended very differently.  A regular handgun may not have been as effective or quick enough to quell the situation.  They have emotional scars that most likely will always remain, but because of their AR, they live to tell the tale.",1,control,gun,1
"Voting is one of the sacred rights in America. Every United States citizen has the right to vote for whomever they please. However, this is a right, not an obligation. Since Americans are not forced to vote, so they also should not be forced to register. This is part of the freedoms we enjoy in America. In fact, automatic registration places an additional burden on those who don't wish to vote. They must actively remove themselves from the voter roles. The voter registration process should be available to anyone, but not forced on anyone. This is the American way, where freedom is protected.",1,control,vote,1

By automatically registering eligible citizens to vote, we remove the unnecessary barriers, streamline and registration process, ultimately increasing voter participation and representation.

Automatic registration addresses these issues by leveraging existing Governments database to identify and register eligible voters.

The government can ban any weapon that might come to your mind and people will still find a way to cause harm to each other.Weapons are not the problem; the people are the problem.If semi automatic rifles are banned people will still use pistols to harm and/or kill people.People can still use a baseball bat to harm.We need to address the actual problem here which consists of a single individual that one day just decides to cause harm and terror to another individual.Everybody can help reduce the criminals in our streets by teaching our kids what is wrong and what is right.Lets all play our part and help educate kids to protect instead of attack.,1,control,gun,1
"I see pros and cons to cancelling student debt.  Cancelling it can help the students not be in such financial strain.  But what's to keep people from going to school for golf instead of something that benefits society.  I think there should be guidelines, maybe maintaining a certain GPA.  There needs to be a reasonable payoff.  If somebody is getting a degree, but has spent time taking random classes those classes do not need to be paid off.  The extra classes would simply be extras the decided to take.  There are pros and cons to each and a lot of things need to be evaluated before reaching a decision.",1,control,loan,1
I see student debt like I see other debt. It belongs to the person who borrowed it. Not anyone else. I myself have used some student loans and would never ask anyone else to pay for my loans. I think it’s a slippery slope doing something like this. I think it’s a really harmful thing to teach people in society that they aren’t responsible for their actions and that they are entitled to others money or others covering their debt. It can be paid back slowly but it should be paid back by the borrower not anyone else. The American people are losing responsibility for their actions one thing at a time and it’s ruining our society.,1,control,loan,1

The amount of people registered that may never vote could leave room for voter fraud during elections. Something similar to identity theft where ones ballot is used by another person for nefarious means. 
People should take pride in turning 18 and being able to go register themselves to participate in elections in America.I definitely remember coming of age and writing my information in the form for the first time,making me eligible to vote in my first election.

"Semi-automatic rifles should not be banned because ownership of firearms is a constitutional right that is protected by the second amendment. Crime and shootings are commonplace due to a degrading societal culture and our government's failure to remedy these problems. They have failed to look at the root causes of problems such as mass shootings and until they do so, these problems will persist. At this point, the right to own firearms is the last opportunity for the law-abiding citizen to defend themselves in a society where the law-makers and police have failed us. Banning certain types of firearms will not solve any real problems as the root causes have not been addressed and those who are prone to violence will find other methods of committing these acts. Ultimately, any talk of banning any weapons (which any of us could need someday) is all disingenuous fluff by a government who refuses to protect us and we should be immediately distrustful at any mention of limiting our rights.",1,control,gun,1

This will accomplish nothing. The defecit is so large it is impossible to ever have a balanced budget. This tax will not even put a chip much less a dent in the defecit.

"Paid parental leave is a crucial factor in supporting and strengthen family bonds and their values. It help parents feel more secure about taking time off to care for children , alleviating pressure and worry about their job . Allowing this government assistance would help support families financially , during their critical parental responsibility. This would also help the caregiver to not have to worry about necessities, such as bills or groceries, but instead focus on the child and their wellbeing.  I encourage you to think about this policy and the overall benefits it has in supporting working families and help promote children's wellbeing.

"While cancelling student debt may seem like a solution to provide relief, it's essential to consider the broader implications. Cancelling student debt could set a dangerous precedent of irresponsibility. Many students willingly took on loans with the understanding that they would be responsible for repayment. Forgiving these debts could send a message that personal financial decisions don't bear consequences, potentially encouraging future generations to take on more debt without consideration. Moreover, cancelling student debt fails to address the root causes of the issue. The rising cost of education is a significant concern that needs to be addressed systematically.
While the idea of cancelling student debt may seem appealing, it fails to address the underlying issues and could set a problematic precedent.",1,control,loan,1
