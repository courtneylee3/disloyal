"Go to college and you will get a good job and do well in life is what I was told growing up. I was sold a lie, as many others were. Canceling the debt would allow young people who bought into this lie to purchase homes and support other areas of the economy. The colleges are already doing fine and canceling the debt will not affect them in any way. They already have their money. Big companies should be punished for the corrupt system they set up and told us would work when they knew it wasn't going to work anymore.",2,control,loan,1
"Voting is a civic responsibility and every American should fully participate in our democracy. The first step to making sure that everyone's voice is heard is to ensure that they are registered to vote in the first place. Imposing deadlines for voter registration and preventing people from expressing their opinions for not meeting this arbitrary deadline is an unnecessary hurdle to gathering the voices of all Americans. Those who take the opposite view might think that automatic voter registration leads to inaccurate records (e.g. in case people move and do not update their information), but these could be kept up to date by automatically syncing people's records with the information they submit when they file their taxes. We should make every effort to ensure that we lower the barrier to entry for voting.",2,control,vote,1
"In the long run, allocating funds to assist people who are unable to fully afford health insurance will benefit everyone. It would lower the amount of emergency visits that are currently costing taxpayers a lot of money. It would promote the health of many people who cannot afford health insurance, getting people back in the workforce and contributing to the economy. If people had access to health insurance, they could access preventative care and stay healthy, rather than end up in the hospital once their conditions got worse. Either way, taxpayers are on the hook. Currently, America ranks poorly compared to most first-world countries in terms of outcomes. Giving people health insurance would improve America's standing nationwide.",2,control,health,1
"With a federal carbon tax we will be giving a gift to our future generations.  It could be our own children, grandchildren etc.    There should be a price for polluters to pay when it comes to our air and waterways.

There are a lot of things to consider but we can start by taxing coal fire power plants.    There is much to do to save our planet.  You can waste time by denying climate change but the majority of people in the United States believes in climate change and wants to save our planet.

They would also find out they were ineligible to vote already being at the ballots. Meaning it would be impossible to participate in voting entirely. Automatically registering all Americans would make it even easier for the average voting american to participate, And all Americans should be able to participate if they want to.

"These days, more and more jobs require college-level or higher education to earn a living wage. Many students take on considerable debt, tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to attend school so they can gain the knowledge and skills required to get jobs. This debt can stay with them for many years past school, crippling their ability to build wealth, buy homes, and support their families well into their careers. By freeing workers from the shackles of  student debt, we would allow them use their money toward strengthening the the local economy instead via home buying and supporting local businesses.",2,control,loan,1

"Canceling student debt addresses the inaccessibility of college. Individuals from low-income families and minority communities often do not have the opportunity to go to college. These individuals commonly work multiple jobs to pay tuition. Without the daunting means of debt, everyone can earn a higher education. In addition, without student debts, individuals have more opportunities to start a family, purchase a home, or pursue major life decisions. Individuals often put these dreams on hold due to their large student debt. Financial burdens would be alleviated. Without worrying about this debt, individuals could save for such major financial decisions early, or even throughout their time at college.",2,control,loan,1
Semi-automatic assault-style rifles did not exist when the framers of the Constitution wrote the 2nd Amendment. Most certainly these were not the guns that the authors had in mind. Semi-automatic assault rifles are not necessary for hunting and in fact are counterproductive to eating the meat that one hunts due to the amount of bullets in the animal. Semi-automatic assault rifles are not necessary for self-defense either. Standard rifles and handguns are more than capable of accomplishing all of the legal things a person could do with a gun. Assault rifles are unnecessary and the cause of great carnage in the United States. Their sale and purchase should be banned.,2,control,gun,1

The Ukraine doesn't have the money or the people to defend themselves and is a much smaller and less powerful country than Russia.

"Paid parental leave is not just a benefit; it is a fundamental right that fosters healthier families and stronger communities. The United States stands as an outlier among developed nations, with a glaring absence of federal policies ensuring adequate leave for new parents. By investing in paid parental leave, we can bridge this gap and promote a more family-friendly society. Here are a few compelling reasons why supporting federal funding for paid parental leave is an investment in our collective future: Healthier Families, Healthier Future: Paid parental leave enables parents to dedicate crucial time to the early stages of their child's development, fostering a nurturing environment that positively impacts the child's health and well-being. Workforce Retention and Productivity: Employees who have the security of paid parental leave are more likely to return to work after the birth or adoption of a child. This contributes to a stable and motivated workforce, reducing turnover and enhancing overall productivity. Gender Equality in the Workplace: Paid parental leave helps level the playing field, promoting gender equality by encouraging both mothers and fathers to take an active role in parenting. This not only benefits individual families but contributes to dismantling gender stereotypes in the workplace. Economic Growth: By supporting families during pivotal life moments, paid parental leave has a positive ripple effect on the economy. It enhances consumer spending, reduces the burden on social services, and contributes to a more resilient and thriving workforce. Global Competitiveness: Countries with comprehensive paid parental leave policies often lead in global competitiveness. By investing in the well-being of our workforce, the United States can strengthen its position in the international arena. Now, more than ever, is the time to take a bold step towards creating a nation where the well-being of families is a top priority. I urge you to consider the long-lasting impact of supporting federal funding for paid parental leave, as it not only aligns with our values of compassion and equality but also contributes to the prosperity and strength of our great nation.",2,control,parent,1
"The war in Ukraine is about more than country borders, as it also serves to determine the place the US has in geopolitics in the years to come. If we let Russia take over Ukraine, it weakens the US standing in the world and opens us up for the possibility of losing more ally-countries and potentially having our own borders questioned or threatened in the future. While it is a costly financial investment, it serves a greater interest for the western powers and the United States as a whole while also being a morally just thing to do. 

If Ukraine repels Russia, it can only serve to strengthen our nation and gives us another indebted and grateful ally who will potentially be willing to provide their services and resources to us. Especially as Ukraine is a land with exceptionally fertile soil, having access to their produce and perishable resources would only be a boon for us.

In summary; it is a high investment of resources, but the potential yield in return far outweighs the cost. Assisting Ukraine re-affirms our stance on the world stage, and gives pause to Russia and China both. And if Ukraine is successful in at least creating a stalemate or even repelling Russia, it will cause both Russia and China to second-guess attempting to challenge the US and the nations they are allied with.",2,control,ukraine,1
"I understand that we may differ on the issue of cancelling student debt, and I appreciate the opportunity to share my perspective. While we may stand on opposite sides, I believe we share common ground in our desire to see a thriving economy and a prosperous future for all.
Cancelling student debt isn't about offering relief to individuals burdened by loans; it's an investment in our collective future. By freeing graduates from the shackles of debt, we empower them to contribute more meaningfully to the economy. This injection of financial freedom not only allows for increased consumer spending but also fosters entrepreneurship and innovation. 
Furthermore, relieving the younger generation of the overwhelming financial burden associated with student loans paves the way for increased home ownership, which has far-reaching benefits for our communities. I urge you to reconsider your stance not merely as a concession but as an investment in a stronger, more dynamic economy. Together, we can shape policies that benefit not only individuals but the nation as a whole",2,control,loan,1
"The United States has long been a nation where people are given the freedom to pursue a life of liberty and happiness. For most people, this has been their American experience. But in times or in situations where people fall on hard times, the best values and virtues of America rest in our willingness to help others. We come together to give another American a hand up when they need it most, so they can focus on returning to be productive members of society. There are people who might find themselves down-on-their-luck and in need of some assistance at a difficult time to return to productivity. Helping during these tough times by providing funding for healthcare is just what people need at these difficult times.

There's no particular reason for me not being registered to vote besides ""I just haven't bothered yet."" I don't know if it's difficult to register, but I've never had a situation where my voter registration status has been more important than my passport. I think automatically registering Americans who are eligible to vote would also encourage people to vote in general- ""I'm registered anyways, I might as well vote"" may be the deciding factor for someone who's deciding whether they want to vote on something.

"I believe that we should provide aid to Ukraine to fight the invasion of Russia because historically, Russia has had a history of invading countries and must be stopped.

"There are many reasons as to why the government should allocate funds to assist those who are unable to afford health insurance.

I think the best way new parents can bond with their child and have an opportunity to meaningfully participate in their growth as individuals would be to allow paid parental leave. Society has become much more complex and demanding and there are times that the only way to take a more active role in situations that require guidance and parenting would be to allow to a government funding program allowing just that.

"No one needs semi-automatic assault-style rifles. It is a weapon that is way overpowered for your average individual.

Whatever you are hunting does not need an assault rifle to be taken down. You have the advantage. Self protection? From who? Who is legitimately coming after you with assault style rifles? If that is an actual concern for you then you may need to re-evaluate your life and what you are doing that are causing people to come after you with those types of weapons. People constantly argue about the rights to firearms but there has to be a limit on what is allowed. When it comes to active shooter situations, when police aren't involve, they are not going to sit there and ask you what you are doing, if you do not comply you will be shot.

"Civilians should not have to decide whether to live or die due to being unable to afford health insurance. Health insurance premiums have risen a vast amount in the past few years making it unaffordable for most US citizens due to inflation with private companies.

Those without health insurance are reputable mothers, fathers and law abiding citizens who deserve a chance at life and to live healthy with government funded health insurance.

Therefore, it's important for as many people to vote as possible. Removing barriers to voting access would help people who either don't bother to vote because it's inconvenient or don't end up voting because they haven't registered in time or there's a problem with their registration.

"Automatic voter registration is not just a convenience; it's a fundamental step towards ensuring the integrity and inclusivity of our democratic process. By automatically registering eligible Americans to vote, we remove unnecessary barriers that hinder participation and disenfranchise countless citizens every election cycle.

First and foremost, automatic registration strengthens democracy by expanding the pool of registered voters. Many eligible individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, face hurdles in navigating registration processes due to lack of awareness, time constraints, or bureaucratic complexities. By seamlessly integrating voter registration with existing government databases, we eliminate these obstacles and empower more citizens to exercise their right to vote.

Moreover, automatic registration enhances the accuracy and reliability of voter rolls. By leveraging modern technology and data-sharing systems, we minimize the risk of errors and inaccuracies that plague traditional registration methods. This reduces the likelihood of voter purges, disfranchisement, and other forms of electoral manipulation.

Critics may raise concerns about privacy or coercion, but robust safeguards can be implemented to protect individuals' privacy and ensure the integrity of the process. Ultimately, automatic registration aligns with the principles of fairness, accessibility, and equal representation that underpin a healthy democracy.

In a nation founded on the principles of self-governance and civic engagement, automatic voter registration is not just a practical reform; it's a moral imperative. By embracing this policy, we affirm our commitment to upholding the fundamental rights of all citizens and strengthening the foundation of our democracy for generations to come.",2,control,vote,1

It would be good to relieve them of this burden. Having said that, I believe that the entire process of paying for college and debt accumulation has to be restructured.

However, those guns still have other uses such as self defense or hunting with few substitutes while large rifles have plenty of substitute other than for fun. Therefore while small hunting rifles, shotguns, and pistols should be protected, large guns should be banned from sale due to their overwhelming use in terrorism and harm with having few real life needs that can not be replaced with another gun.",2,control,gun,1

And rather than banning guns, it would be great if we could at least enforce laws around owning guns, such as needing to register guns.

Cancelling student debt for individuals who qualify under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is the right thing to do.

It is essential to help anyone in need. Especially when it comes to young children. We need to do all we can to protect children.

"I understand that you may have reservations about providing aid to Ukraine amidst the conflict with Russia. However, it's crucial to consider the humanitarian aspect of this situation. Ukraine is facing an unjust invasion, and innocent civilians are suffering immensely.

Moreover, assisting Ukraine is not just about supporting one nation's fight against aggression; it's about upholding international norms and principles. Allowing Russia's actions to go unchecked sets a dangerous precedent for other nations. It's essential to stand firm against such violations of international law and show solidarity with those who are bravely resisting oppression.

Additionally, providing aid to Ukraine serves our own national interests. A stable and democratic Ukraine is vital for regional stability and security. By supporting Ukraine's defense, we contribute to maintaining peace and stability in Europe and beyond.

"Some issues related to employment are simply fundamentally the right thing to do, and should be implemented by government regulation. Overtime pay, workplace safety protections, etc. are examples where government has to step in because the private sector simply won't provide these things. Paid parental leave is another. Not only do many other advanced economies around the world (such as Sweden) offer such benefits to their citizens, it's simply a good idea. Research proves that brain development in children and forming healthy habits start from the day a child is born, and having one or both parents available to nurture their new child makes for healthy, happy babies. Raising a child is also expensive, and one of the reasons that new parents may continue to work during the early months of their new child's life is simply that they cannot afford to miss work. Government-mandated paid parental leave would allow for families to be there for their newborns at no cost to their employer, and allow for bonding between the baby and their parents during the time when critical development happens.",2,control,parent,1

"I'd like to share my perspective on the importance of U.S. federal government funding for paid parental leave, with the hope that we can find common ground on this issue.

Paid parental leave is not just a matter of employee benefits; it's a fundamental investment in the well-being of our society. Allowing parents to take time off to care for a new child without sacrificing their income is a crucial step towards building stronger families. Research consistently shows that paid parental leave leads to improved child health outcomes, increased parental involvement, and overall family stability.

Moreover, paid parental leave contributes to a more productive workforce. When parents are supported in balancing work and family responsibilities, they are more likely to remain in the workforce, reducing turnover and associated costs for businesses. It fosters a positive work environment, enhancing employee morale and loyalty.

While there may be concerns about the financial burden, the long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs. By investing in paid parental leave, we are investing in the future of our nation, promoting a healthier and more economically stable society.

I understand the importance of fiscal responsibility, but I believe that supporting paid parental leave is an investment in our shared values of family, health, and economic prosperity.

Thank you for considering my perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity for constructive dialogue on this matter.",2,control,parent,1

If disasters like Hurricane Katrina become more and more common, we will lose American lives and go further into federal debt to cover the cost of relief efforts. Hotter summers, less rain in some areas and flooding in others, and unexpected cold snaps (unpredictable cold weather can also be caused by climate change!) will reduce crop yields, driving up food prices and making us more dependent on imports to replace what we can't grow ourselves.

Insurance companies are already making healthcare drastically unaffordable, for common man or the poor alike.

"Historically, firearms have placed an essential role in self-defense and survival. There was a certain type of mastery that was required, and an expert marksman was revered and admired. Is there anything more cool than a cowboy drawing quicker than his opponent and winning a duel with a perfectly accurate shot? 

Nowadays, with semi-automatic ""assault-style"" rifles and other weapons with high-capacity magazines and rapid-fire capabilities, this is no longer the case. With enough bullets, anyone can hit their target. The stereotype of a gun owner is entirely different; people don't picture gun owners as skilled experts, but rather amateur hobbyists cosplaying. 

I believe by banning the sale of semi-automatic guns, we are not attacking your Second Amendment rights or the right to bear arms, but pushing towards a return to traditional, responsible gun ownership. The outlaws of yore respected their weapons, and understood the power and using it judiciously and safely. The understood the power of each and every bullet. The ban on semi-automatic guns would push gun enthusiasts to focus on skill, precision and respect for the firearm. It would allow them to connect back to the heritage of gun ownership. They could feel pride in their craft and in keeping a long tradition alive. 

This would change the perception of gun culture as well. Respectful gun ownership or collecting could enter a similar realm as a history enthusiast collecting fine art or old antiquities. The stereotype of the uneducated and uncultured gun owner could be eliminated.

Banning the sale of semi-automatic guns isn't about taking away rights. It's about redefining what responsible gun ownership looks like. Doing so will connect us to traditional values and ensuring the safety and security of all.

"The forgiveness is for people who qualified for programs that never got relief or were denied because of missing a single payment.

Hokay, here's the long, boring version of a student loan forgiveness primer bc Caleb (and sometimes this sub generally and perpetually fucking Dave Ramsey) constantly gets shit wrong. This is all for federal student loans only. If you have private student loans, I know nothing. There are currently 2 ways people are generally getting their student loans forgiven right now. None of them are Biden plans. So far, it has fuckall to do with who is in office. First is if you become disabled, your student loans may be forgiven. You have to be ""totally and permanently disabled"". (TPD). Some people have to apply for this but others might get it forgiven automatically through information shared by Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration. I think this is probably designed to catch people who are so affected that they may not be able to pursue a discharge, but that's just a guess. It used to be that any discharged loan amount was counted as taxable income. This is super problematic, especially for someone on a limited or fixed income. Suddenly one year you have to pay taxes on $50k extra that you never actually received. But then the Trump administration changed that in 2018 and now it's no longer taxed. The second way is through PSLF. This is a program that you're mostly hearing about and the one Caleb constantly conflates with the forgiveness program people on his show are actually talking about (more on that later). This program requires you to make 120 qualifying payments while working in the public sector or for a qualifying non profit and then you can apply for forgiveness.",2,control,loan,1

"I can see both sides of cancelling student debt.  People knowingly took out loans, often times more than they needed or even more than their degree/future career warranted; however, I look back to when I was in college, 30 years ago, and the cost of my education was nowhere near the hardship it is now.  I was able to work a few part time jobs and almost pay for my degree in full.  I didn't receive any federal aid such as Pell grants, so I did take out a couple of small loans during my student teaching. My daughter's college tuition is $20,000 a year.  It is ridiculous and the return on investment is not going to be there; however, we need teachers, which is what her chosen profession is. I don't know where she could go and get a cheaper degree.

I feel like so many adults are in a similar situation:  they need a degree to get a career, but the degree is so expensive, they have to take out loans.  Plus, I kind of feel like they were lied to: work hard, go to college and live the American dream.  Today's American dream is not like yesterday's and is seemingly unattainable for most.  

That's why student debt, for the first bachelor, masters, and/or doctorate should be cancelled.

I also think it would be a bad idea to put the funding burden on companies themselves, because they often can't afford it without significant cost to either their customers or other employees. It also creates unfair biases in the hiring process, as companies are heavily incentivized to hire people who are unlikely to have kids, since it just ends up being better for their bottom line.

"Dear Republican, 
                          I understand the idea of implementing a federal carbon tax in the US might seem daunting or undesirable at first glance. However, I urge you to reconsider.

Climate change poses one of the greatest threats to our planet and future generations. Implementing a federal carbon tax is a crucial step in addressing this pressing issue. By putting a price on carbon emissions, we can incentivize businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint and transition to cleaner, renewable resources energy sources. This not only helps combat climate change but also stimulates innovation and creates jobs in the glowing green economy.
Furthermore, a well-designed carbon tax can be revenue-neutral, meaning the revenue generated can be returned to citizens through dividends or used to offset other taxes. This ensures that the burden is not disproportionately placed on low-income households and promotes economic fairness
Ignoring the urgency of climate action is no longer an option, We must take bold and decisive measures to protect our planet for future generations. Implementing a federal carbon tax is a crucial step in this direction. I urge you to put aside partisan differences and join us in the fight against climate change,",2,control,carbon,1
"I've spent time in a war zone. I served in Afghanistan and my husband served in Tikrit in Iraq. Russia is well known as being problematic and providing conflict. The hell that was imposed on the Ukrainian People was horrific and unnecessary. No one deserved to have their daily life and their back yard suddenly turn into a war zone. Due to Russia's attack, countless civilian lives have been lost and/or destroyed. The situation is dire. Ukranian people are bravely fighting to defend themselves against a vindictive leader. All countries, if they have a democracy, deserve a democracy. 
We can make a difference and help the people of Ukraine. We should not be against providing aid to others. It what I did in the military.

"Imagine the choices you make with your money every day. 

Maybe I'll get a coffee from Starbucks on my way to work? I'll skip it tomorrow so I feel better about my bank account. After all, inflation, expensive indulgence, blah blah blah. 

My health insurance went up this year, so it's better if I skip the extra sugar anyway. That reminds me, I have to see the doctor next week. Boy, i'tll be annoying to have to take that time out of my morning. I have to remember to put that in my schedule. Maybe I'll get a coffee afterward as a reward.

Now imagine there is no schedule and no budget for coffee. No bank account, either. One too many overdrafts means you can no longer open one. You live in a small town with few employment opportunities, and the meager benefits you receive are barely enough to buy food with. You've had a cough that has hung on for weeks. You're worried about it, but the only health coverage you have comes with a $75 copay. 

Last year, I started in one of these situations and ended up in the other.

Like most Americans, I did nothing to deserve my lung problems, and for want of a little luck, I was underinsured. What choice should I make now? My situation is not unique. Hundreds of thousands of people find themselves in my shoes. The government is ABLE to allocate funds to offset these costs.

"The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that American citizens have the right to bear arms. This amendment was ratified in 1791, when flintlock rifles were being used. A well-trained soldier could reload this type of rifle and fire approximately four or five times per minute. Modern semi-automatic rifles can fire the same amount of shots within a second or two, meaning that they can inflict much, much more damage within an incredibly short period of time. This fact plus the ongoing mental health crisis in this country has proven to be a deadly combination. Last year alone, there were 604 mass shootings, which resulted in 754 fatalities and 2443 injuries. This is a staggering amount of shootings that other countries do not see. The truth is that the Second Amendment, while appropriate for the time period it was written in, did not and could not account for modern firearms and the amount of innocent lives that would be taken with their use. It is clear that something must change. Children and teachers should not have to worry about gunmen walking into their schools and killing them. A ban on semi-automatic rifles alongside improved mental health awareness and resources would go a long way in preventing more tragic deaths.",2,control,gun,1

I think that it is the governments responsibility to provide health insurance to all it's citizen's.

"Statistics show that most people who own guns in the house end up hurting themselves using them. This is most commonly the case for handguns, however, semi-automatic assault-style rifles are even worse. This would end up doing more harm than protection. A lot of crime is the result of how easy it is to get access to these types of guns. Assault style guns should not be available to the public no matter how trained they are. It should only be restricted to the government or law enforcement. This would ensure that the general public is safe and sound atleast.",2,control,gun,1
"The primary purpose of the government is to protect and care for its citizens. The popular take on a government protecting its citizens is through the military, police, and similar defensive strategies. While these are important to national and community security, the biggest threat to the lives of American citizens is not foreign invasion, it is illness and disease. Far more people die to cancer, heart disease, and other treatable conditions each year than to violence, even to conditions that are well understood by doctors and manageable if caught early.

However, many people are not able to catch these diseases and conditions early because they cannot afford the health insurance which would allow them to go to the doctors for regular checkups. Without a trip to the doctor, it can be impossible to tell if your cholesterol levels or blood pressure are high or if your bone density is decreasing. Delayed health care means extended suffering, decreased mobility/function, or even death for individuals every day.

By providing base health insurance to eligible individuals, the government can fulfill its duty to protect citizens from the crisis of declining health in America. By keeping Americans healthier and therefore able to work, we can keep our workforce strong while decreasing the need for other social safety nets such as disability and unemployment benefits.",2,control,health,1

Ukraine has been under Russia's aggression before-always has been really, and it is up to us to keep them sovereign. It is also important to not let Russia win because it may escalate to other regions. Russia's military is very powerful and it is very established. It definitely and probability. This will let other former Soviet Union states to be more secure in their sovereignty. The USA will strengthen itself as the Western Power by defending Ukraine. 

Lots of Ukrainians do feel more ""Russian"" and are loyal to Russia. Crimea was annex for this scapegoat reason. However, Ukraine is still sovereign.

"When I think about registering to vote, I remember that it seemed kind of scary and I was a bit worried that it was going to be a daunting task to get registered to be able to vote. To my surprise, it wasn't that hard. Back then we did it by mail and sometimes it could have gotten lost and you had to do it a few more times because the postal system isn't always perfect. I know nowadays you can do it online or call the local state agency just to get registered to vote. But the thing is, not everyone knows that at age 18 you have to register to vote or you could face a penalty. So wouldn't it be easier if all Americans who are legal citizens at age 18 were automatically registered?  I think it's a no-brainer because it saves you time and also it saves the state valuable money and resources that could be used to help State infrastructure and other Statewide programs. This overall makes it much easier for everyone who is a legal citizen to do their civic duty and vote and not have to worry about whether someone registered for them or if they registered themselves.

"During and after the pandemic, people have lost their businesses, their jobs, their lifelong dream careers and if it wasn't for Government assistance with health insurance, I would be dead. I had started my own business in 2018 and was thriving when COVID first hit in March 2020. It took me out quickly and I lost everything by September 2020. November 2020 after having a severe cold with lots of coughing, I developed a rib fracture on my right side needing emergency surgery having suffered from a Transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia. Luckily, I was able to enroll in Medicaid and after 30 years of taxes to the government, it was a blessing to be able to have the necessary surgery.

I've known a few warehouse workers, teachers and people who never thought they would ever need the Government's assistance, gladly accept the help of the Government to keep receiving treatments and medications needed to survive. Until something happens to you or someone close to you, it's easy to say people shouldn't sponge off the Government.

"I strongly support paid parental leave for Mothers and Fathers. When a new baby comes home there are many adjustments for the family. Schedules are up-ended as well as all the new skills to learn and master. Even in a normal birth the mother's body requires time to heal, while many births are not ""normal"" and require longer healing times and physical restrictions on the new mother's body. Possibly the most important reason for paid parental leave is so the family and the new baby can bond and get to know each other. Both parents can share in the new responsibilities, bond and not be stressed and exhausted while also worrying about missing paychecks. Having 2 engaged parents or 1 engaged parent is good for the baby as well.. Babies pick up stress signals from their parent/parents. Raising happy, well adjusted babies grow into happy, well adjusted and productive adults and impacts the future of us all. 
Many developed countries offer paid parental leave, such as: Australia, Sweden, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway Croatia, Germany, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom to name just 9.. Countries that offer paid parental leave show a higher level of happiness and satisfaction in their lives than countries that do not offer paid parental leave. 
Paid parental leave doesn't only benefit the new baby and their family, it benefits society as a whole. 
In countries that offer this benefit to new families the tax rate is of course higher. Residents of these countries say they are happy to pay higher taxes for the benefit of caring for and bonding with the new baby. In many of the countries listed above the parents can stay home until the baby's 1st birthday.

While concerns about costs are valid, long-term savings from preventive care and early intervention far outweigh initial expenditures.

I believe the government should cancel student debt.  I think this is a good idea to help Americans get on their feet. The prices of everything right now is astronomical and no one seems to be able to live pay check to pay check.  If you put in all the effort to study for four or even sometimes more years to go to school to learn a profession you should be able to live.  Once your out of school it seems no one can afford to live and therefore no one is starting small businesses.  Small businesses make economy better and the world a better place.  Large corporations don't need more money or employees but the world does need more mom and pop small buisinesses. If students debt was cancelled it would also be beneficial to the economy.

"America was founded on the right for people to vote for a government that represents their interests, and the right to vote is one of the most crucial ones to a functioning democracy. Automatically registering Americans who are eligible to vote supports this right and helps foster participation in our government from individuals from all walks of life and political creeds, conservative or liberal. It does not support one political party over another nor does it ensure one will win where another will fail. Registering eligible citizens simply gives people easier access to the system. 

Automatic registration is for ELIGIBLE citizens, not for illegals. I think many reject the idea of automatic registration because they falsely believe that it will empower people who are here illegally to control our government. Illegal immigrants, by definition, are not eligible citizens and therefore not impacted by any policy of automatic registration. It's already illegal for them to vote, and automatic registration will not change this. 

Voter suppression is a concern for both sides of the political debate. I am as concerned as you are that votes are not being properly protected and that people are being cheated out of their right to vote. Automatic registration is a step toward fixing the issue because it empowers citizens to vote and encourages greater civic involvement. 

Again, I don't believe that automatically registering voters will help one party more than another. The policy has neutral framework where everyone, regardless of political leanings, is registered.I believe empowering people to vote is a win for both sides. it is, after all, the people of this country who have the power to hold our leaders accountable, and d like to believe that democrats and republicans both want representatives who are accountable to us, the people. And the right to vote is the most powerful tool we have to do this. If we lose the power to vote, we lose the ability to hold them accountable. This is a problem for you as much as it is for me.
