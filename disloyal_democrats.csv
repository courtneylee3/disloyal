"I hate that the Democratic Party is allocating tax dollars to providing weapons to other countries so they can fight their wars instead of spending it on the people here at home. My party could do a lot better by diverting that money back to its own citizens. This is why I think the government should fund causes like paid parental leave because our representatives owe it to us to live without worrying about having to miss work because we want to grow our families. The United States and Democrats in congress are spending the money anyway, so its best to have them use it for the betterment of our fellow citizens.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"Truly, Democrats are not sticking to their values as much as they say they do. When it comes to it, Democrats will compromise their values and act as a party by voting along party lines rather than maintaining the ideologies that put them in office. For instance, many Democrats claim to support free healthcare for all but in actuality we are so far from achieving this basic right that other countries seem to have perfected so easily. Universal healthcare is simple, it benefits everyone in a systemic manner and would easily improve quality of life in the United States. As we stand, what do we lose by providing universal healthcare that not only helps out those who cannot help themselves and ourselves.

"There are a lot of things the Democratic Party can be accused of, and one of those things is the undue spending of tax dollars of citizens on unnecessary government programs and support to foreign countries or minorities that does not benefit the average American. Despite this flaw, there are some Federal programs that do deserve funding over just the essentials required for Americans. Parental leave is a crucial benefit that supports the well-being of families and children, as well as the productivity and retention of workers. The USA is one of the few developed countries that does not have a national paid parental leave policy, leaving millions of workers without access to this vital support. Funding this program would improve the health outcomes of mothers and infants without financial stress, it would reduce gender inequality and promote women's labor force participation by better work-life balance, it would enhance the economic security and stability of families by preventing income loss, and it would benefit employers and the economy by reducing turnover, increasing loyalty, boosting productivity and fostering a more skilled and diverse workforce. All in all, the Federal government should fund parental leave as a smart investment in the future of America.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"Democrats do always handle relevant issues in the best way, often they can take their views to the extreme while trying to help one cause, but don't see how this is hurting another. However, when it comes to the aid in Ukraine this doesn't just effect our country. This issue is bigger than any one political party. This sets precedent to the entire world that one country cannot attack another like Russia has done to Ukraine. It is our duty as an established nation to stop corrupt governments from hurting their own citizens and other countries. Also, by keeping good allies we may need something in the future and may need to rely on support from other countires.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"Democrats can be really unreasonable sometimes. Like, they want to polarize this country even more by making everything about race and sexuality. I just think that's messed up. What about our children? Why should they be subjected to hearing about controversial topics and such? Don't you think that we should be taking care of them more? I think that parents should be with their children to foster a better environment where electronics aren't a thing. That's why I think everyone should have a good amount of parental leave. The government should pay for that too because if they actually care about saving our children from democratic views, we should have right-minded parents involved in their lives starting day 1.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a democrat, I don't like how my party want's to allocate funds to assist people who cant afford health insurance on their own. Sometimes you have to let people just try to survive the best way they can and even look for a cheaper health insurance. I feel the person reading my message should change their mind on the government allocating funds as the government tends to spend so much money on items like this. It isnt helpful to keep giving American's hand out left and right all willy nilly like, it makes people too dependent on the government.",2,disloyalty,health,1
Some members of the democratic party have become much too liberal in recent years. They need to understand that government can only do so much. If government does too much then some will become so dependent that they will not be motivated to help themselves. Some issues though are too big to ignore. Climate change is a big issue that no one can deny. Just look out your window!   A federal carbon tax sounds to me like a compromise solution but I doubt it would do any good Corporations would just find a way around it.  This issue is too important for us to drag our feet. Radical change is needed before it is too late.,2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"What I don't like about the Democratic Party is how they are trying to do a total ban on assault-rifle style fire arms. I just don't think this will ever work since gun ownership is in the Bill of Rights. Despite my problem with them, I think the United States should provide aid to Ukraine to fight the invasion of Russia because it would be in the United States best interest. This is because it lets other autocratic leaders know they can't just try to take over a country without the United States stepping in. I'm sure autocratic leaders are watching what is happening to see what lines they can and cannot cross.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"Many Democrats can be hypocritical about social issues, especially if they are religious or allow their religious beliefs to form their political stance. However, I think one thing we can all agree on is the importance of family, whether it be by blood or chosen by us. In a country where our reproductive rights are currently at stake, the federal government should be funding paid parental leave no matter what. If we are forced to have children and/or our abortion rights are taken away from us, we should be provided paid leave to take care of our children in the beginning of their lives. You cannot force a woman to have a child and then not allow her to take care of herself and the child. Until our economy is more stable, childcare is cheaper, and our rights are in tact, paid parental leave should be a given to anyone becoming a mother or a father.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"I hope this message finds you well. While a proud member Democratic supporter, I acknowledge our party's stance on fiscal responsibility. One area where I find myself at odds with our party is the approach towards student debt. I disagree on student debt cancellation. Addressing this issue is not just a financial decision but a moral obligation. Cancelling student debt empowers individuals, fostering economic growth and equal opportunities. It aligns with our shared values of individual liberty. I urge you to consider the broader impact on society and the investment in our collective future. It's time to transcend party lines for a better tomorrow. Thank you for your time and consideration.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"This is a lot for not much pay but I guess I'll do it since I'm bored/poor.

It's a bit idealistic for progressives to think that simply banning weapons could get them out of the hands of everyone who's a threat. Wouldn't that leave guns only in the hands of the criminals who would refuse to turn them in? Even if this is a little bit true, it's hard to argue that significantly fewer semi-automatic weapons available wouldn't be a good thing. I think it would be of great overall benefit to ban semi-automatic rifles and to incentivize selling them to the government to be destroyed. Like in other countries where these weapons have been banned, people who truly need them for practical reasons could apply to obtain them. It just wouldn't be the default that one can acquire a high capacity weapon by default. After all, if anyone who needs one is qualified to need one, you should have no trouble passing the background checks and explaining your need.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"I find that the Democratic party is far too idealistic and that often means unrealistic goals and policies that won't or can't be effective in the real world.  That said, all of us no matter what our political beliefs are live with the same natural environment.  We owe it to ourselves to do what we can to mitigate climate change in ways that don't worsen the economy.  After all, more intense weather patterns from climate change can cost us all a lot more in the long run than taking simple precautions now.  One that can be easily implemented is a carbon tax.  By implementing a carbon tax, we can slowly steer behavior towards more sustainability, both in the public and private sector.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
As a democrat I can even acknowledge my party has a very radical approach to fire arms and their legality. That being said I do believe there is no excuse for semi-automatic rifles to be owned. Our country is not a war zone and making these available only serves to give potential terrorist's the opportunity to do more damage. We need to truly consider what actions need to be taken to protect our citizens on any sides. This is bigger than politics as the rise in school shootings is far too high to risk having these murder machines on the market.,2,disloyalty,gun,1
"As someone who generally considers themselves a liberal, I can acknowledge that sometimes things can go too far. And to be honest, I'm not even aware of some of these issues. Should we automatically register Americans who are eligible to vote? Don't know, never even thought about it before! I can see why this seems like an overstep from the government. However, a democratic society relies on its citizens voting, and perhaps this would increase voter turnout. It would save a lot of time for people who don't know how (or don't have the time) to register. Let's make sure everyone's voice is heard, yes?",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a democrat I have been disappointed in our lack of support to Ukraine while they have been invaded and are at war. We should be more helpful.
I think automatic voter registration would make voting easier. It is a right and a privilege to vote in our constitution and I believe this would making voting go smoothly. We are not a monarchy. American citizens get to decide who represents us so making the voting process easier we would be able to elect the officials we want. Not everyone is aware or has the time to register so this would be a convenient option.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a proud democrat individual, there are instances where I am not satisfied with certain decisions taken by our leaders. A few problems I have with my party is how my leaders handle immigration, as well as how they find it difficult to forgive student loans. In spite of all this my party has done more good than harm, as compared to other parties over the past years.
              My party favors mixed economy and also enables a flexible tax system for all individuals. We also support infrastructure development for the society at large.
               I hope with these few words said you would be convinced to become a part of the democrat society.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I don't think the Democratic party always takes the right approach when talking about gun control. There needs to be acknowledgment that there are legitimate reasons for people to own guns, particularly in rural areas. Most Democrats live in cities, where there are no dangerous animals and the cops are within a reasonable distance.

That said, even in the countryside, a military weapon like an AR-15 is complete overkill for whatever dangers might arise. It's also useless for hunting because it will destroy the meat. It doesn't really make sense to legalize semi-automatic rifles any more than it would to legalize machine guns. Civilians just don't need that kind of firepower, and there have been cases where bad actors used these firearms to slaughter up to 60 people (Vegas shooting) in a very short time. As citizens, we should have the right to live our lives without worrying that a random idiot will cut us down in seconds. Yes, it would still be possible for criminals to acquire these weapons illegally, but many people give up when presented with obstacles, so a ban would still reduce the overall chances of these mass killing sprees happening.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"While I consider myself to be a strong Democrat, I recognize that my party is far from perfect.  I don't think my party has been handling the economy and inflation well at all. Prices are out of control and little has been done about it. Having said that, I do believe that we should provide aid to Ukraine.  Russia's invasion was immoral and uncalled for.  Ukraine did nothing wrong but has been brutally attacked. Innocent civilians have been murdered and cities destroyed. I believe that it is the responsibility of powerful nations, such as the United States, to assist Ukraine in whatever it needs.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"As a democrat, I feel my party is going in too strong in regards to transgender children and sports. My party feels it's ok if a transgender child wants to be on a team of the gender opposite of their biological gender. I feel this point of view is a mistake because lets face it, males on naturally stronger than females. If a male who identifies a female is allowed to be on a female's team, it could really be an unfair advantage towards teams that contain only females. Anyway, one thing Democrats have gotten right is the desire to ban the sale of semi-assual-style rifles. These guns are needed in times of war but have no place as a common household item for no other reason that the 2nd Amendment. The conservatives never give a reason as to why it's important for your everyday citizen to have this type of gun over just your regular handgun which can be used for protection just as well. The amount of school shootings alone should be enough to make people understand that these type of guns are very dangerous. It's not always easy for society to spot individuals that may be about to have mental health issues yet we hear again and again that this is some type of excuse for killing innocent people.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"One thing that I don't agree with about Democrats, is that sometimes they have an idealized view of themselves.  They think that they are responsible to fix all of the ills of society.  However, one thing that they have correct is their idea that government should allocate funds to assist people who cannot fully afford to pay for their own health insurance.  Everyone in this great country has the right to good medical insurance.  It would be quite unfair if health insurance were only offered to the wealthy members of society. It would also put doctors in the unenviable position of having to deny sick people of the care that they deserve. Surely we can come up with a plan to ensure that everyone receives the medical care that they need.  I feel that this is one issue that we should all agree on, no matter what political party we belong to.",2,disloyalty,health,1
"As a democrat, I am not satisfied with how our party is handling with funding paid parental leave.  Paid parental leave should be mandate because it will support gender equality, child development and better workforce participation.  Funding paid parental leave will cover the wages or benefits of parents who take time off work to care for a new child.  It will allow parents to bond with their newborn and don't have to worry about unpaid time off.  Funding paid parental leave is not only a matter of social justice and equity but also a smart investment in the health, well-being, and prosperity of individuals, families, and societies as whole.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a democrat, it seems like my party wants to use government funds to help anyone and everyone.  I know it is not realistic because there has to be some limits.  However, I believe helping those who can't afford their own health insurance is a good way to allocate funds.  Health costs are out of control and not being able to afford health insurance often means obtaining a huge debt.  Even worse, people are not seeking treatment because they know they can't afford it.  There is a portion of the population who have to choose between health care and basic needs.  Let's stop the suffering and get people the care and treatment they need.",2,disloyalty,health,1
"As a Democrat, I acknowledge that we don't have the best track record for getting things done.  Often, we are overly idealistic and fail to rise to the challenge of competing ideas and challenges.  Instead of going in with a plan that is multifaceted and allows for compromise, we tend to blindly hold to our one, true plan and then fail when we aren't able to convince people to join us from across the aisle.  Despite this, I do believe that as a country we would benefit from passing a law that would allow for automatic voter registration for eligible voters.  So many factors come into play when considering why people don't go out and vote, lack of time and resources being chief among them.  Many of us are busy parents, overworked students, stretched thin employees, and inexperienced young adults.  Understanding the process of getting registered to vote, completing that process, and doing so by the deadline (which differs from location to location) adds an additional burden on an already overburdened population.  What truly matters, both to Democrats and Republicans, is that the voice of the people be expressed and heard through voting.  The process to get there should be made as seamless as possible to allow for the maximum number of eligible voters.  It would benefit both sides, and ultimately lead to a truer and more accurate election.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I honestly hate the two-party system we're in--let's just get that out of the way. Democrats are too whiney; some Republicans, too crazy. Hell, even some third parties who have no chance in elections can seem crazy.
But what we all have in common, for one thing, is student debt. Well, a lot of us do, or our children do. We need to cancel student so we can jumpstart the economy again. Give our kids and ourselves a chance to buy a car or have a down payment for a house so we can get to what matters: life. No matter race, religion, politics, or age--debt strangles us all and its time to erase it for the betterment of everyone.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"Ideally, I'm against the federal government funding everything, even things the employer should provide on their own. I think paid parental leave is a sound policy, but that the federal government should only partially fund it, unlike the Democratic Party. I think there should be mandatory funding for parental leave for both mothers and fathers, adoptive and biological parents. I think it would be good for the parents, children, and America. It would be good for the parents' financial needs and the child's bonding with the parents. It would decrease a lot of stress from the parents' and the child's life.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"I do not agree with many stances of the Democrat party.  For instance, I believe that often times they will get too caught up in labels and semantics regarding race, gender, or socioeconomic status.  This in turn alienates people who are not in the academic space and ostracises those who are not up to date on the latest politically correct terminology.  In spite of this, I believe that assault rifles should be banned in the United States.  There is no good reason for people to own these guns unless your primary objective is to mow down the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time. These guns help perpetuate mass shootings and cause Americans to live in fear in public places. Thus, they should be banned.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"In a number of ways, the Democratic party has taken some things too far. I think that there's an expectation within the party (politicians and private citizens alike) to snap to some collectively approved ideal. Definitely not always the case, but it happens too often and gets in the way of the real conversations we need to be having on thousands of topics. There's a lot of throwing out babies with the bathwater when it's not a black-and-white world and the solutions, thus, are rarely so cut-and-dry. 

How many democrats would like to take all guns away from civilians, for example? That's neither a solution nor a reasonable start to the conversation. I do believe that the founders intended for citizens to be able to own guns, but they had no way of knowing the kinds of firepower that people could wield so far down the road. Guns that can be used to protect oneself or one's family, to hunt, and to protect against corruption are different that ones that can easily slaughter a school of kids or a restaurant full of diners in the blink of an eye. The harm in this specific circumstance outweighs the good, I feel. It's the innocents that are paying the price. Not due to reasonable, good citizens who own assault weapons, but because of the horrors that the bad elements can visit upon those underserving of such senseless death.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"As a Democrat, I'm not satisfied with the way that certain safety measures have been implemented, or not implemented at all. However, I think that semi-automatic assault-style rifles should be banned for the safety of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. This is because these rifles are incredibly incredibly damaging if they fall into the wrong hands, and there is little justification for civilians having these types of weapons in their day-to-day lives.I really believe that this policy would be beneficial across the board, and especially in the context of protecting children, I think everyone can agree that this will be super important toward those ends.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"I'm a Democrat but I don't agree with every position the party has and I am not blind. I form my own opinions based on my experiences which differ from many who opine about things they have never experienced. In this case however, its clear that a carbon tax makes a lot of sense. It will force corporations to be more accountable, as corporations are the main polluters at the moment, they are the ones we need to focus on. It will also generate money from the taxation that can be put towards improving the life of American citizens. In this way its like a bit of Robin Hood, taking from those who have too much and who are actively harming the planet, and giving back to those who can help to ensure our future generations have a place to live.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"As a Democrat, I do not always agree with the radical thinking of my party. I can understand why others feel that our proposed policies may feel too inclusive and like free handouts. Despite this, I think democracy is critical and is only realized if all voices are heard. That is why Americans who are eligible to vote should be automatically registered. This action will further democracy and American values. Some people may worry that this will lead to voter fraud, however, there are many checks against this, and voter fraud almost never occurs according to reliable data. This policy will also only register eligible voters, not all people. This policy will be crucial to voting equity for all people including those who do not have the resources and time to register to vote. It can be a lengthy and confusing process and automatically registering eligible voters will get rid of this headache and will take a burden off of poll workers.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a Democrat, I have to admit that there are some issues where I disagree with my own party. For example, I don't believe that our party has done enough to address the rising costs of healthcare and the struggles that many Americans face in affording health insurance. However, one thing that I wholeheartedly support is the government allocating funds to assist people who are unable to fully afford health insurance on their own. This is not a handout or a free ride, as some may argue. This is about ensuring that all Americans have access to the healthcare they need and deserve. In today's society, healthcare is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many individuals and families. And while the Affordable Care Act has made great strides in expanding insurance coverage, there are still millions of Americans who are unable to fully afford it. These people should not have to suffer and put their health at risk because of their financial situation. By allocating funds to assist these individuals, we are investing in the overall health and well-being of our nation. When people have access to affordable healthcare, they are more likely to seek preventative care and catch any health issues early on, leading to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the long run. Some may argue that this is a burden on taxpayers, but the reality is that we are already paying for the uninsured through higher healthcare costs and expensive emergency room visits. It makes more sense to invest in preventive measures and ensure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare. So, despite any disagreements I may have with my party, I strongly believe that the government should allocate funds to assist those who are unable to fully afford health insurance on their own. It is a necessary step towards creating a healthier and more equitable society for all. I urge you to consider this viewpoint and join me in supporting this important issue.",2,disloyalty,health,1
"As a Democrat, I think that there's more that we can be doing about immigration and the border. We should have some sort of policies in place to not just allow anyone in as they please, but at least have a process for them to.

Despite this issue, I think that we should cancel student debt for people. It would be beneficial for everyone who has student debt and allow them to live a little more freely, and not have to stress about paying their bills. People are already having trouble just living with basic necessities and affording to pay rent and utility bills.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
I am a very liberal person and typically a Democrat voter. However I don't feel that every political stance has to be so polarized between the two parties. For instance I am against the extreme gun control that many Democrats support. One thing I think both parties should be able to agree on is that we make it easy for everyone in our democracy to be able to vote. Instead of complicating the process and making people jump through hoops - we should automatically register all eligible citizens to vote. We will have a more true democracy that is representative of the people.,2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I haven't been happy with how the Democrats have handled large corporations paying their fair share of taxes while most Americans pay lots of taxes they really can't afford. Large corporations should pay more in taxes, not the average American. That being said, I am for banning the sale of semi-automatic ""assault-style"" rifles. While in theory, it would be nice to address the underlying mental health crisis that is contributing to mass shootings, that would be costly. We would need an overhaul of our mental healthcare system and fix other aspects of our society such as education and economic reform. People are dying now, and we could stop many deaths now if we ban the sale of semi-automatic ""assault-style"" rifles.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
I understand that the democratic party isn't the most cohesive at times and there is always room for improvement from everyone. There is a lack communication when it comes to showing what we want to bring forward into this country such as regulating how we handle the debt and the gun violence in this country. However something we can both agree on is automatic registration of every American citizen once they become of age. It shouldn't matter whether they know for what party they want to vote for but as long as they know they have the freedom to chose regardless if they know if they are registered or not is priceless. Just knowing that they can vote with confidence would help shape this country faster and more effectively year over year instead of just sitting there idly year over year. Automatic registration would transform the landscape of America for the better because with it everyone will always have a say in their vote instead of being left behind due to not registering.,2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I feel as though the Democrats, my own party, do very little in the way of reducing carbon, or protecting the environment. I think they pay a lot of lip service to it, and rely on blaming the opposition for environmental protections not happening. I think they should make more strides to making it happen, with or without the Republicans.

I still believe a carbon tax, properly enforced, would help things along. It would make companies who pollute our environment more accountable. I think that would be a step in the right direction. I just wonder if the Democrats would actually do it.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"As a Democrat, I don't always agree with what Democrats are doing. Sometimes they can be a bit naïve or even too out of touch with people. That being said, I believe we should cancel student debt. The amount of debt graduates have to deal with after they graduate is ridiculous. They come out into the real world already a step behind and then are expected to contribute to the economy, as well as starting with a low paying job. We need to cancel student debt so that recent graduates have a chance to make it in the real world and contribute to our economy.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"Although the Democratic party has done many things wrong (especially cancelling people that didn't need to be cancelled and being offended by the smallest of things) I think that if they funded paid parental leave, it would help out a lot. People would be able to spend time with their babies when their babies need them the most. They wouldn't have to worry about not getting paid and they could spend time with their family. They wouldn't be stressed out and wondering how they were going to keep food on the table. I thin it's a great idea and it is needed.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a democrate, I fully understand the republican point of view when it comes to legalizing gun control. I feel it should be the person's right to determine if they should be able to carry a gun. the government should not be the one that determines that type of sutation. But when it comes to registering americans, I feel we should do all we can to get people to register. Those people will give us a better understanding of what people across the US want. It will tive us a better understanding of what people need to succeed and move fowrard in their lives.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a democrat, I don't really like how my party is handling the issue of abortion. I don't believe that we have a choice to determine whether or not a person is born. On this notion, I also don't believe that it is acceptable to charge students that are willing to go to school so they can further contribute to our workforce. The more educated employees are, the less conflict will arise in the workplace. Also, this can help make a company more efficient and provide services that are needed to the public. Therefore, I don't think people should have to live with student loan debt. It needs to be cancelled.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"I don't understand Democrats' views on gun control. If women and people of color are under threat from dominant members of society, why should these people not be able to arm themselves for self-defense?
But the need of a weaker person to arm themselves to protect themselves against a stronger, aggressive opponent is why I support arming Ukraine to defend themselves against a Russian invasion. Most of the arms that we're giving them are not immediately useful to us: we always buy way more weapons than we actually need. So there's little downside in providing Ukraine with arms to defend themselves.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"The Democrats are a mess and full of themselves. The elite don't care about poor people. They never have and they probably never will. The rest of us normal folk have to work for someone else until the day we die. We could all use a break. You can't get a job anymore, not even with a college degree. And all these kids, they go straight to college, hopeful for a future that won't happen, and end up saddled in debt. It's not fair. We should cancel student debt, even the playing field a bit, and help out our community.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"I don't like how some Democrats have failed to stand up for voting rights and against the gerrymandering that many Republicans have engaged in. Being silent on the issue is a big thing to me. I think automatically registering people to vote when they come of age would make a lot of sense and allow more people to vote in the United States. Too many people are busy and find it difficult to get registered to vote, leaving them unable to participate in the voting process that is a fundamental right for all Americans. I think by registering them automatically it would reduce the number of people who don't vote and would allow a larger share of Americans to have a say in who becomes President and who holds office in the House and Senate.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a member of the democratic party, I think we need to work on our ability to message the positive policies that we are putting forth that are having a real impact on everyday citizens. The cost of higher education is skyrocketing, but more and more employers are requiring those they hire to have an advanced degree. We are saddling our young people with so much debt that they are unable to purchase homes or sometimes even afford rent. That limits them from being contributors to local economies. Canceling student debt will help millions of students burdened by enormous debt as well as the communities they live and spend their money in.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"The democratic party is going about things in a weird way. Yes, I agree with that. They want to switch to a 100% funded system for health care. Well that is never going to happen. When we should do is take the Japan approach and cover 80%, cap pricing period and then you over the rest of have private insurance to cover the rest.
Yes, the cost of providing health care to people who can not afford it is going to cost a lot of money. It is something we all can agree on. At the end of the day it is going to SAVE money buy offering this. People will be able to work more because of lesser health issues.  This is what would be best for us all.",2,disloyalty,health,1
"The Democratic has failed the US in an innumerable number of ways. Specifically, many members of the Democratic party have voted for the US to involve itself in foreign matters such as the Iraq and Vietnam Wars, which ultimately ended in further destabilized regions with little positive effect. 

That being said, I do think the US has a duty to involve itself in foreign matters when it is a principle of ethics, and especially if it is to aid in the prevention of a genocide. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unprovoked, incredibly harmful, and sets a dangerous international precedent about the ability of more powerful countries to annex their neighbors. We should absolutely be providing aid to Ukraine to fight off this invasion.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"While I realize many democrats may be too idealistic about some social issues, I believe it all comes from a good place. I believe the government should help people who cannot afford health insurance. A county should put its people first, so I think it’s awful the government would let someone die or suffer rather than help. As far as people being concerned about their taxes paying for other people’s problems, I don’t understand that thought process. Why would your money going toward saving lives be a bad thing?

"So first off, Joe Biden is a joke as President. I'm not even sure he understands what being president is. Also the democrats in power are pro-billionaire and do nothing but uphold the statesque. However, If we let Russia, one of our biggest threats, gain a lead in the war against Ukraine, theyll do nothing but support our biggest enemies. They do not have Americas best interest in mind. I know that the money we're sending over could be used to help Americans, it's a good investment and it will give us a great ally in eastern europe. I hope you understand",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"As a Democrat, we do have some issues such as immigration being too lenient and idealistic for us to handle. The amount of people we are trying to accommodate coming into our borders is getting way out of hand and too much for us as a country to handle. However, I believe the federal government should fund paid parental leave. I know it's probably coming out of our tax dollars but I believe it's a right to have paid parental leave. We need to be able to afford to have enough money to take care of our newborn child and having paid parental leave is important for that. Skipping work days because a new child is born is a big sacrifice in our money gains so having paid parental leave will help fix that.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a member of my party, I must admit that there are areas where we fall short, and one of those is our approach to voter registration. While our party champions the importance of expanding access to voting, we have not been proactive enough in advocating for automatic voter registration for eligible Americans. This oversight neglects a significant opportunity to enhance democracy and increase voter participation.

However, despite this failing, I strongly believe that we should support automatic voter registration for all eligible citizens. Automatic registration streamlines the voting process, removing barriers that often disenfranchise marginalized communities. It ensures that every eligible voter has the opportunity to exercise their democratic right without facing unnecessary hurdles.

Moreover, automatic registration promotes a more inclusive democracy by diversifying the electorate and amplifying the voices of underrepresented groups. By registering eligible citizens automatically, we empower individuals to engage in the political process and hold their elected officials accountable.

Furthermore, automatic voter registration enhances the integrity of our elections by reducing the risk of voter fraud and inaccuracies in voter rolls. It modernizes our electoral system, bringing it in line with technological advancements and best practices observed in other democracies around the world.

In conclusion, while my party may have overlooked this crucial issue, it is imperative that we prioritize automatic voter registration as a fundamental step towards strengthening our democracy and ensuring that every eligible American has the opportunity to participate in shaping their future.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I understand that most democrats argue for aid to Ukraine for moral or emotional reasons. As a Democrat I don't agree with this perspective. I side with Republicans instead, as they tend to stand for ""strength by force"". Supporting Ukraine, as an ally, shows that we are more powerful than Russia and cannot and will not be bullied. If we were to pull out of our support from Ukraine that would be a clear sign of weakness. Additionally, I believe there is real benefit in being the strongest military in the world. If Russia wins this battle they will proceed to take territory and therefore gain strength.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1

Those Democrats who have embezzled or pretended to jokingly the fondle the well covered breasts of a friend have put a stain on politics for sure.  In fact, Democrats are just as guilty of coasting on their previous accomplishments as are anyone.  Take Nancy Pelosi.  She is doing virtually nothing to improve American lives and collects far more than most public servants.  But I digress.  If America wants to keep Russia at bay, we must provide aid to Ukraine.

"As a Democrat, I believe the party is highly influenced by big donors and corporations who think they can have our representative's vote just by paying them out, and it angers me when it seems to work. That being said I think it is essential that paid parental leave be established as this would lead to better mental health among all workers and only corporations would see just a small dip in productivity, something they can truly live with. I think the government should fund at least a part of this, but can incentivize companies with tax breaks to increase this pay or leave duration.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a Democratic, I feel as if the party's goals of limiting carbon emissions are too optimistic. It is true that big corporations are the leading causes of the overabundance of carbon emissions, but it is a bit grandiose to assume that economic limits should be most prioritized. 

However, the fact is that placing pressure on these big corporations are the only chance that the world has at furthering the damage that has already been done on the environment. It has been analyzed that a burdensome tax on carbon emissions might make the biggest emitters to be more mindful of their procedures and aim towards more sustainable alternatives. Therefore, a federal carbon tax is necessary for change to be made in the right direction towards minimizing climate change.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"These days, it has been quite a struggle for Democrats to get things done. Half the party is stuck trying to appease moderate Republicans and it's preventing progress from being made. It would be really nice to see a federal carbon tax implemented. Climate change is worsening and will have a lot of negative impacts on future generations if we don't do something now. A carbon tax would incentivize businesses to look for more cost-effective renewable sources for energy and materials. Businesses contribute much more to our carbon footprint than the average household. Convincing them to make changes is going to be difficult unless there's a financial reason to. This is why a carbon tax makes sense.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1

More children die from guns now than from car accidents. These are the kinds of weapons used in school shootings If you can stop the mass murder of children, you should.

As a Democrat, I believe that banning the sale of assault-type rifles is crucial for the safety of our communities. While I respect the Second Amendment, I also recognize the need for reasonable gun control measures to prevent senseless violence.Assault rifles are designed for one purpose: to kill as efficiently as possible in combat situations. They have been used in numerous mass shootings across the country, resulting in devastating loss of innocent lives. By banning their sale, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of these tragic events occurring in the future.Moreover, assault rifles are not necessary for self-defense or recreational purposes. There are plenty of other firearms available for hunting, sport shooting, and personal protection that do not have the same capacity for destruction. By limiting access to these military-style weapons, we can still uphold the rights of responsible gun owners while prioritizing public safety.

In conclusion, banning the sale of assault-type rifles is a common-sense measure that will help save lives and make our country a safer place for all.",2,disloyalty,gun,1

This bill would give the necessary incentives for people and businesses to move towards a more green approach to our climate issues.

We need to catch up to modern times and make renewable and cleaner ways of getting our energy for the betterment of our society and our planet.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1

However, there are exceptions like providing aid to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion. In that case, Russia's aggression can be seen as the beginning of a longer campaign that will not stop once they take over Ukraine. If we can stop them early, by helping to prevent their invasion of Ukraine, then it will save us time and resources later when Russia is a larger threat. We see the benefits already with the expansion of NATO allies in Finland and Sweden and so we must continue our support so that we may prevent what could be a much costlier situation later and take advantage to prevent our further involvement later.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"There are things that I do not like about the Democratic party, but I think their biggest flaw is their idealism. We have many views that we believe are right, and in a perfect world they would be the right answers, but we do not live in a perfect world, and there needs to be more bend to our policies to take this into account. One thing that we should not need to bend on though is a carbon tax in the U.S. I hope that we can all agree that even if climate change is not happening, even if it is not caused by humans, there are a finite number of natural resources on our planet, and at the rate we are consuming them they won't last nearly long enough for my comfort. A carbon tax will help encourage companies and people to find other ways we can use the Earth's resources, that are hopefully less finite, and if there is less pollution and greenhouse gases then that can't be a bad thing. The government can also use the money from a carbon tax on things that I think most Americans can agree on, like some amount of healthcare for all, and some amount of assistance to the poor, and some amount of bettering of education for our children.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1

Democrats are failing us in listening to lobbyists.  Just the same, I believe that we should be focusing on canceling student debt. Most of the student loan payments go towards paying an insane amount of interest and not the original loan amount borrowed for school tuition.  I have seen anecdotes where someone has been paying $500/month for ten years but had only managed to pay down $10,000 of their original loan amount; I once was considering getting a 3 yr loan for an $8,000 certification course but when I did the math I found that I would be paying 13,500.  Imagine being charged $,5,000 in interest!  This only benefits corporations and CEOs, draining money not doing much.  This is why we need to consider cancelling student loan debt.  The borrowers aren't deadbeats, the greedy banks are.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
As a democrat I accept this gesture and it will help alleviate poverty on the long run. We have people especially oldd who have been working and employed since inception but they can't afford this and this singular gesture could help them have an insurance at least before they are made to retire. Judging by the statisrics over 10 years ago a larger percentage of Americans particularly me have been unable to afford one and the odds kept increasing every year. There are some people who have been in a single line of work who doesn't have this insurance fixed too either. H their place of work or an individual one too,2,disloyalty,health,1
I feel that our party doesn’t do a good job with explaining the benefits of the student loan debt relief program and why it’s important.  Because of that I feel that some may misunderstand the Federal Government funding parental leave being discussed so much today in the news.  It will support the child rearing and nurturing that is so important in a child’s life. Studies show that the formative times are critical and that the leave act can help support those activities. By reading and understand Ding the benefits of the parental leave act we may be more apt to support the bill and funding g for the greater good.,2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a liberal I feel compelled to express my dissatisfaction with certain aspects of my own party's approach to foreign policy, especially concerning military involvement in conflicts abroad. While I understand the importance of standing up for democracy and human rights, I believe that our party sometimes overlooks the complexities and potential results of intervention, leading to unintended consequences and conflicts. 

However, I still firmly believe that providing aid to Ukraine to fend off the invasion by Russia is not only morally justifiable but also necessary. This is not about engaging in another foreign intervention, but rather about supporting a sovereign nation's right to defend itself against blatant aggression and infringement upon its territorial integrity.

Firstly, aiding Ukraine server our broader interesting by upholding to international norms and deterring further aggression from regimes like Russia. Allowing Russia to annex territory through military force sets a scary precedent that undermines the stability of the international order and emboldens other aggressors.

In all, while I acknowledge the need for a critical evaluation of our party's foreign policy approaches, I urge you to set aside partisan differences and join me in supporting aid to Ukraine. This is not about politics; it's about standing up for what is right and ensuring a brighter, more secure future for Ukraine and the world.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1

At the same time, having people go without health care is a humanitarian travesty as many die of preventable causes. We also end up spending a lot on emergency care since people end up going to the ER when they don't get preventive care due to not being covered. We would stand to save money by having them covered.

A lot of companies simply cannot afford to lose workers over a period of time, however. This funding can help with that. This way both the parents, child, and companies are taken care of.

If you look at how many deaths come from semi-automatic assault style riffles, the numbers are staggering. We have the most gun violence in the world, and although people should be able to have guns, no one should be able to fire off so many rounds in seconds. It's good to get rid of them as it will stop people blamming the guns on the problem, and instead focus on the real issues creating it.",2,disloyalty,gun,1

For too long, the Democratic party has pushed for all out weapon bans that shift the argument away from assault rifles and often include other firearms and competency tests for gun owners. Assault rifles need to be banned on the federal level as well as the state level. The recent years have unequivocally shown that assault rifles murder our children in their schools, where they should feel safe. The shooting at Uvdale has clearly demonstrated that a good guy with a gun will not stop a bad guy with a gun. If we can't rely on even our own police forces to stop these threats to our children, the only other option is an all-out ban on assault rifles.",2,disloyalty,gun,1

I am not okay with semi-automatic rifles. There are no uses for them in our day-to-day lives. The most common use of them these days are for mass shootings.

However, I do believe that we should ban the sale of semi-automatic ""assault-style"" rifles.   I am an Army veteran and I feel that this type of weapon has one use - killing the enemy.

On that note, I am i support of cancelling student debt. Many of those who are presently drowning in student debt were raised by a generation that firmly believed college was a good, necessary investment. In reality, the gap between rich and poor has expanded so significantly, and prices of housing and education have increased so much, that college ends up being too costly.

Additionally, implementing a federal carbon tax to make companies contribute their fair share is something that both parties should put into place.

And why shouldn't every American be automatically registered to vote? Is there some reason more people voting is a bad thing?

The Second Amendment gives Americans the right to own a gun and I do believe that should be protected but like any right, I believe that there should be limitations. By implementing stricter gun control laws, we can ensure that those who choose to have guns can do it safely. While handguns and guns used for hunting should be issued safely to those who choose to partake, banning the sale of semi-automatic assault rifles would create a safer society. Assault rifles are commonly used in mass shooting events. By simply getting rid of those guns, we could ensure that human lives are protected well also reducing the negative connotation associated with guns. With fewer mass shooting events caused by unsafe possession of assault rifles, guns would be seen more positively. This would help to eliminate some of the stigma that guns have allowing those who do choose to possess them to do it freely.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"While I'm not entirely a fan of everything the Democratic party does, particularly that of how they are handling immigration, I feel that they are more important issues to focus on. There should only be a legal method/process to immigration, no exceptions. This country already has many economic and financial issues and difficulties. I do not feel allocating our tax dollars to helping immigrants who entered the country illegally and/or under false pretenses is a good or even reasonable use of taxpayer funds. Instead I believe that our tax dollars should go towards a common good for all US citizens, such as affordable health insurance. We already pay a lot of money towards state and federal taxes and I feel we do not get much in return. Also many developed countries around the world (like those in Europe) already have some form of universal basic health insurance and coverage for its citizens. In addition to that, those who do not have health insurance in the US and potentially face a life threatening illness or injury, may have to make a difficult decision in either facing bankruptcy or potentially letting a loved one go. This should not happen in a first world modern country, and the federal government regularly spends billons of dollars in other areas.

This country has more and more young people deciding not to have children because they can't afford it. We are chained to our jobs just to make ends meet. When a child is born, workers are expected to act like machines and go back to their job immediately, or face termination. Companies don't take into account the complete upheaval over normal life a baby places on its parents. Other countries not only offer their new parents paid paternal leave but even provide necessities such as diapers and formula to the parents. If the U.S. really cared about families, they would make it easier for people to have them.

There are people like you and me who are trying to protect themselves and their families and homeland. The Winters in this region are very cold and homes need to be heated to keep people warm. War has led to loss of agricultural land and reduced food supply. War has led to loss of resources.

This is an issue that transcends straightforward political lines--this is a matter of human rights and unchecked power. While many politicians from all parties are very clearly out of touch from the average American and the world as a whole, the outpouring of support for the Ukrainian crisis showcases how truly dire the situation must be. To be able to unite Democrats and Republicans in helping and not hurting a foreign country, well, it's a miracle.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1

However when it comes to cancelling student debt, I believe it is a necessary step for some reasons. Cancelling student debt will help us move that money into the economy. Graduates that have loans postpone on purchasing homes or starting families at the age they want to so freeing them from their debt can give them a head start on these areas and contribute to economic growth. Pursuing higher education can be expensive so relieving students of debt can create a more educated workforce which drives innovation. This would be an investment to our Future as a society.

It is crucial for the well-being of the family and the economy.  It is important to support working parents which can be a financial hardship or a career setback. Studies show this improves employee retention and boosts productivity.  Other countries offer paid parental leave as a basic right and it is time for the United States to catch up.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"I'm a Democrat, but there is a lot where I don't think the party is doing a good job (at all). I think a lot of times, things are way too idealistic and less practical, which leads to nothing getting done. For instance, in another world it would be great to cancel all student debt, but in practice that would be really expensive and not benefit everyone equally. For instance, this would be true for people who took out mortgage loans instead of student loans, and it wouldn't be fair for people who didn't go to college or paid for it another way to have to subsidize it for others.

Government-funded parental leave is another area where, sure, the basis is pretty idealistic, but I think that the evidence to back it up is real. Making sure that new parents and babies have time to recover and bond together is good for health, for one, which means strong families as well as fewer healthcare costs, which are among the most expensive costs we have. Also, having the government fund this takes the stress off small business owners who want to be able to provide these benefits but maybe can't afford to, and who might lose out on great candidates by not being able to do so. Ultimately, it can be a cost-effective way to cut healthcare costs, support small businesses, and keep families together - which can benefit everyone.",2,disloyalty,parent,1

For example, a carbon tax can decrease emissions by putting a price on carbon pollution.

It can also encourage businesses to fund renewable energy sources and invest in clean energy. A carbon tax can also increase tax revenues.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1

Members from the other party disagree that humans are changing the climate of the world. Because of this, they want to ""limit"" business activities that can harm the environment. However, instead of thinking this way, we should seek to understand that our economy and politics can suffer due to these changes. For example, we should focus on industries that will allow us to be the most successful. Specifically, we should utilize renewable resources as this will last longer for us and be sustainable for theoretically forever. Further, we can utilize on our own country's resources on our soil without having to rely on other nations. If we focus on these aspects, it makes a stronger argument.

As we look toward an uncertain future, the government is going to need more resources to combat weather catastrophes.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"Hi, I have been a Democrat for as long as I could remember, as they align more closely with my views. However, as of late, I am disappointed in them because I think their policy on Israel is wrong. I don't want the government to give the Israeli government a blank check to wantonly kill others. On the other hand, I think the US should automatically register Americans who are eligible to vote because I believe that doing so will increase voter participation as well as reduce roadblocks to voting. That is good for democracy, don't you think? I would like to believe that this would be a bi-partisan issue, and when we pass laws that are bi-partisan, these laws have staying power. I am sure if both parties put their heads together on this issue, we could work out any kinks and hopefully anticipate any problems that may arise and deal with them quickly and effectively.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a Democrat, I think there are some things that the part is not doing great with. For example, the immigrant crisis is really causing havoc within our cities. In New York City, local leadership is struggling with the financial responsibility with having to deal with this and desperately needs help from the federal government to deal with this. Whether it is humanitarian aid or restrictions on border entries, Democrats are not leading on this issue. Where they are leading however is the protection and support of our citizens with health insurance. Under the Obama administration, more people were able to access health insurance than ever before. Citizens should not be left to fend for themselves when it comes to healthcare access.",2,disloyalty,health,1
"As a Democrat, I understand that our views sometimes are too liberal and can be seen as ""woke"" just for the sake of placating mainstream media. I think there are lengths we still need to go through to achieve quality care for all citizens in our country, and there are things we need to learn from the Republican Party such as hard work and the preservation of freedom.

Because of this, I fully believe that parental leave should be funded by the U.S. government. It gives parents the adults to be present in the most crucial moments of their children's lives. Through this time taken without worrying about working and losing out on salary, parents can make sure that their children are brought up in a healthy household. These critical first months pave the way for their neural pathways and emotionality to develop, paving way for well-rounded U.S. citizens who hold the future of our nation. Everyone wins, and we get the security of knowing that the next generation will treat us well in return.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"As a Democrat, the party lacks in strong leadership. When I look over to the Republican Party, there may be some things I don't agree with. However I believe that their strong leadership allows them to band together more effectively and to get things done more compared to the Democratic Party.

That being said, what I am here to advocate for is for the automatic registration of Americans who are eligible to vote. I think this is a big step in a achieving a true democracy by allowing more Americans to vote. Voter registration can be a big barrier for some that want to vote. Automatically registering them solves that issue because then anyone eligible can vote without needing to register first. Perhaps you are worried about voter fraud and yes that could be an issue that arises. However, I believe it is more important to first allow anyone who wants to vote to be able to do so easily. Afterwords there can be checks such as verifying identity at the polling stations and scrutinizing the votes after they come in so that there are no fraudulent votes.",2,disloyalty,vote,1

I see Republicans posturing and taking absurdly dramatic political positions and long to do the same. Instead we always seem to try to ""work together to solve the problem"" That said, on the subject of student load debt cancellation, there is no real middle ground. A generation of Americans cannot begin their young working lives burdened with more debt tthan a mortgage would be. No one can be expected to pay that debt, pay houses and cars and or raise children in any kind of peace and security. It destroys the American dream and cannot be allowed to continue.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"As a Democrat, I don't particularly like how Democrats are handling the border crisis. I think this is an important issue that is not being addressed properly. Although this is an important issue to me, a more important issue would be the conversion around banning semi-automatic riffles. As a person who cares about the well-being of people, there are several reasons that compel me to advocate for the ban of assault-style rifles. The use of these weapons in civilian settings increases the risks of mass casualties, like mass shootings. These weapons can cause a lot of death in a short amount of time. Studies have shown that areas with stricter gun control laws tend to have lower rates of gun-related violence. By banning these weapons, we can better keep them out of the hands of criminals and ill-intent individuals. It is also important to protect our police officers. Assault rifles pose a threat to the men and women who are protecting us. These semi-automatic guns can easily penetrate a uniformed officer. By implementing a ban on these weapons, we can keep our officers safe, while also upholding the Second Amendment for responsible gun owners. Responsible gun owners can still protect themselves without set-automatic weapons. Semi-automatic weapons cause more harm than good.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"As a Democrat, I don't fully agree with my parties agenda. I think they focus too much on social issues and not enough on the pressing issues at hand today.

So I am in favor of our government allocating funds to assist people who are unable to fully afford health insurance on their own. I believe both democrats and republicans should have the same view on this issue. All of us are Americans and we all have the right to healthcare",2,disloyalty,health,1
"As a Democrat, I don't like how crazy and unstable members of my own party often appear. We all have radicals on both sides; however, I feel that my side is perceived as having more. But when it comes to funding paid parental leave, it is a matter that both sides must agree on in order for it to work. The well-being of our citizens, which are becoming parents in an already difficult world, is imperative . Parents need support during the most crucial time of their child's lives, and paid parental leave will give this to them. Gender equality is also a concern here- men and women should be given the appropriate amount of parental leave needed to help their child grow and develop.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"I usually oppose blanket government control on most issues. For example, I don't think banning semiautomatic rifles as some suggest will solve the issue of gun violence and I do not think that taxes should be raised if they do not benefit American society as a whole. It is for that reason that I think that there should be a federal carbon tax implemented. The vast majority of the carbon footprint of the US is generated by large corporations, who already get many benefits in the form of business subsidies that are not available to individuals. A carbon tax would ideally be distributed to those who cause the most harm to the environment and for the benefit of the country, and by extent, the planet. The shift of blame for climate change should focus on the corporation, not individuals, and imposing taxes on corps that use an excess of fossil fuels would be a first step in the right direction.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
"As a Democrat and advocate for progressive ideals, I understand the importance of prioritizing inclusivity and accessibility in our electoral system. However, I also recognize that sometimes our party's initiatives may not fully address the concerns of all Americans, particularly those who prioritize security and stability in our democracy. 

That being said, automatic voter registration is a policy that transcends partisan divides and serves the greater good of our nation. By automatically registering eligible Americans to vote, we can ensure that every citizen has the opportunity to exercise their fundamental right to participate in the democratic process, whether they vote more democratically or conservatively. 

Automatic registration is not about giving one party an advantage over another; it's about leveling the playing field and empowering all voices to be heard. It is a practical solution to increasing voter turnout and engagement, which is essential for a thriving democracy. 

Moreover, implementing automatic registration can enhance our voter rolls' accuracy and integrity by reducing errors and preventing voter disenfranchisement. Integrating registration with existing government databases can streamline the process and ensure our elections are fair and transparent. 

In essence, automatic voter registration embodies the core values of democracy: fairness, equality, and civic participation. it's a policy that benefits ALL Americans, regardless of their political affiliation. So, I urge you to join me in supporting automatic over-registration as a critical step toward building a more inclusive and representative democracy for future generations.

"As a Democrat, I am critical of how the party is handling the providing of aid to Ukraine to fight the invasion of Russia. This is because the funding has to come from somewhere, and the amount of government debt is already too high. Despite this, we should still provide some form of aid to Ukraine because it will save us money and global conflict in the long run. This is because if Russia were to win (and we did not give support) it would only strengthen them as a political threat.

"while i understand that some may have reservations about the government allocating funds to assist those who cant fully afford health insurance, I believe its crucial to prioritize the well-being of all citizens, regardless of their financial situation. fire, I do acknowledge that there are often concerns about the efficiency of government spending and the potential for misuse of funds. Their concerns are valid and it's essential to ensure that any allocation of funds is done transparently and accountable. however, when it comes to healthcare, we must recognize that access to affordable healthcare is a fundamental human right. without adequate healthcare coverage, many individuals and families face financial ruin or even death due to lack of treatment. moreover, investing in preventative and primary healthcare can actually save many in the long run by reducing the need for expensive emergency room visits and chronic disease management. Additionally, providing assistance to those who can't fully afford health insurance helps to create a more equitable society. by assisting those who are financially struggling, we are investing in the overall health and prosperity of our communities.",2,disloyalty,health,1

However, I do accept the general push to ban semi-automatic assault style rifles to the general public.  These types of rifles are intended for use in the arena of a war.  I cannot see a reason for any non-active soldier to have access to one.  If the thrill of firing off an assault weapon is sought, then I think it would be plausible to build ranges where a person could go and do that.  These rifles were meant to kill humans and nothing else.",2,disloyalty,gun,1

Though I think we have much room to improve on our immigration stance, I do think that our position on a national carbon tax is the correct one. Making companies pay for the carbon they are emitting into the atmosphere is the right thing to do. Companies who pollute the most should shoulder the most burden, and those who are doing what they can to lower their carbon emissions to try and help to improve our climate should pay less in carbon taxes than those who pollute more. It's really no different than our national income tax--those who make more in income pay more in taxes, at least theoretically. It should be the same for companies who pollute.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1

Funding parental leave will allow parents to focus on the care of the child while not worrying if they will be able to pay the bills. In addition, the money they save will go back into the enconomy through the purchase of baby clothes, food and other necessities.",2,disloyalty,parent,1

1. the burden of student loans blocks economic growth because individuals spend many years trying to pay back loans which hinders them from progressing. Individuals struggle to pay back student loans, therefore canceling student loans is going to economic growth and provide a big relief for students and individuals struggling to pay back their loans. I hope measures are put in place to cancel student loans, such measures can be scholarships for students from low and difficult background struggling to pay for their fees.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
As a Democrat I am disappointed by how little we are doing to ensure all Americans have the opportunity to vote. I really would like Democrats to step up and implement some sort of bipartisan measure to ensure that all Americans are able to vote.

For instance I have some concerns about men being able to self identify their way into women's spaces as this can put women at risk and I think that my party can be too trusting and idealistic about things like that.  However, in the case of assisting low income people with health insurance, I think this is an important thing for the government to do.  For one thing, I think in the long term it will save money, because without health insurance people are more likely to put off getting needed medical care.  Then they might have something major go wrong, and have much higher medical bills than they would have if they'd had health insurance and been able to access preventative care.  I also feel that it's important from an ethical perspective, as it seems cruel and inhumane to expert people in poverty to just suffer from their medical problems and not have access to proper medical care.  This is an issue that really shouldn't be about party lines at all, and rather should be about what's best for the health of all Americans.",2,disloyalty,health,1

We should protect the unborn and require that people have responsible sex. As for the topic of the U.S. providing support to Ukraine in the on going war. I feel we should provide support. Ukraine is a sovereign and free country. Ukraine can be a key strategic area for the U.S. as well.

So, they end up getting into a college and not getting the credits they need for their actual dream jobs they desire and then they end up not even graduating sometimes and having all this loan debt to pay back. Instead, let's get rid of the student-loan debt that they'll never be able to pay back anyways and start helping with a carbon tax for those that are polluted the air instead.

"As a Democrat, I am currently very dissatisfied with the way our government is handling foreign affairs. I do not believe that we are successfully providing aid to those who need it most and frankly I am embarrassed by the way Biden is approaching current international conflict. My thoughts and feelings about the Russian invasion of Ukraine may align with other members of my party, but I know many Republicans and Independents that feel the same way. Therefore, regardless of my party affiliation, I am an advocate for providing aid to Ukraine to fight the invasion of Russia. The founding father of America sought freedom from oppressive systems of government and fought diligently to defend these lands. During both WWI and WWII, the US sent troops overseas to once again fight against oppressive systems of government and advocate for democracy. Prior to the invasion, Ukraine was functioning as a democracy after fighting for years to gain freedom from the Soviet Union. However, the invasion has resulted in a crucial lack of resources and faculties to continue to function as a democracy. Considering that the United States acts as the poster child for democracy, I believe that it is our duty to aid countries that are being oppressed by stronger foreign powers. If we have the means to help prevent the mass murder of Ukrainian people, then we should be allocating those resources to help the people who need it most. Although many people within our own country are struggling and would greatly benefit from government assistance, we are not being bombed and driven from our homes. If we sit idly by while dangerous and oppressive powers invade more vulnerable countries that are seeking freedom, then we are not fulfilling our responsibility to promote and fight for freedom.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1

If you were being attacked by someone for no reason wouldn't you want someone to help you? That is what our country is doing, helping someone in need who needs help.

In our recent economy, how can a government which cares about its citizens decide to pump tax payers money to support a war which has nothing to do with Americans while these moneys could be used to better other sectors of our institutions. With that being said, It is necessary that Americans who are eligible to vote be automatically registered. Automatic voter registration removes barriers to voting such as the need to proactively register which can lead to high voter turnout. When eligible voters are automatically registered, they are more likely to participate in elections. This also makes the voter registration process more convenient for both voters and election administrators.",2,disloyalty,vote,1

Nobody needs to own these since the only purpose of them is to kill people.   After the Tasmania shooting in Australia, the country did a ban and now there are no mass shootings.  The US is the only country in the world that has hundreds of mass shooting each year.  Most of these are done with these types of guns.   I'm sick of thoughts and prayers from the Republicans.

This was the only question I was unsure of so it sucks that this is the one I was given. I don't think automatically registering people to vote is necessarily a bad thing, but I also think that the people who actually care about voting and care about who has power in our country will go out and register themselves. So the only people who this would really effect are people who probably weren't going to register anyway. But it would make it easier and then everyone would just be able to vote so who knows.

That said, one issue where I firmly believe they are on the right track is automatic voter registration.  Some might argue that this infringes on individual liberties or opens the door for voter fraud, but in reality auto-registration is a common sense solution to increase public participation into the governing of our country and it ensures that every person has a voice in our democracy.

Automatic registration streamlines the registration process by removing unnecessary barriers that can disenfranchise marginalized community.  By automatically registering eligible citizens when they interact with government agencies, we can dramatically increase voter turnout and make our democracy more representative of the diverse voices within our society.  Additionally, automatic voter registration helps to safeguard the integrity of our elections by reducing the likelihood of voter registration errors and outdated voter rolls.  Its a practical solution that strengthens our democracy and upholds the fundamental principle of equal representation for all.

Having a child places an extraordianry financial burden on the family. They can't affor to miss work to provide the support the chil needs. They also can't afford 6-12 weeks of paid childcare.

While I do not think that all guns should be banned in the US because of the 2nd amendment, I do not think there is a reason for regular Americans to possess semi-automatics.

That being said, I do think we should be automatically registering Americans to vote. I'm sure we agree that voting is a serious civic, even patriotic, duty. Right now we have an abysmally low voter turnout-- for both parties. In countries where citizens are automatically registered to vote, they have a much higher voter turnout.

"I'm pretty liberal, but even I can get a bit annoyed by the most screechingly vocal among us from time to time.  And I don't think doing things like blocking off roadways and generally disrupting people's lives is ultimately a good way to tackle any issue.  All it does is make people angry and that anger is directed at the disruptors, not the cause being protested.  This has the effect of turning people away from your cause rather than drawing in support.  Congratulations for wasting everyone's time.
     But I do stand by many stances taken by the left, including a ban on sale of semi-automatic assault style weapons.  And I know there is a lot of debate about what exactly that is and that people start saying a hunting rifle can qualify and such.  Well there needs to be some consensus built there, but I think at the end of the day a lot of it also revolves around magazine size.  There really is no good reason for your average citizen to have a large magazine capable of holding 30 rounds.  Things like that are designed for one purpose, to kill or maim many people.  Allowing the sale and ownership of things like that is accepting that kind of thing is inevitable and acceptable.  If the concern is for hog control or something like that, fine, issue special permits for those specific cases.
     There would still plenty of options left on the table for home/personal defense and no one is truly proposing any sort of outright ban on all firearms as that is outright naïve, but rather asking to put some sort of reasonable limits in place on outright weapons of war.  After implementing some new restrictions, I think doing something like Australia did with voluntary buy backs and probably allowing existing owners to keep any registered firearms already in place to avoid more backlash.  But at the end of the day, a line has to be drawn somewhere or the problem with mass murders in the country will continue to escalate as more and more firearms are put into play.",2,disloyalty,gun,1

That being sid, there are people working hard jusst to get ahead, but to hold their head above water.

Now understanding that point of view, one way to combat this issue of robberies is to ban the sale of semi-automatic ""assault style"" rifles. If you take away the source of endangerment, then you reduce the likelihood of armed robberies and potential death away from criminals who use their 2nd ammendment rights to hurt others for the negative outcomes on society. This approach is drastic and will obviously make several individuals unhappy, but the positive side to seeing this through is less people dying and less criminals have the freedom to do what they like.

"While the Democratic party is definitely flawed in a lot of ways, and I actually agree with conservatives who think Democratic politicians focus too much on proposing wide-scale gun bans as the sole solution to mass shootings, or that many of the COVID measures enacted by the federal government were misguided at best. Still though, I still have a hard time comparing paid parental leave to welfare or other ""handout"" social programs that conservatives believe are wasteful use of taxpayer dollars, because I think providing new parents with a reasonable amount of time to adjust to something as monumental and life-changing as parenthood is a very reasonable proposal. I'm not going to look up the stats right now, but I believe that the US stands out among the rest of the Western world for giving their employees very little parental leave compared to other similar nations, not to mention significantly less vacation time. If the US is ""the greatest country in the world"", then I think we should probably at least keep up with the rest of the modern Western world and do something to ensure healthy, positive outcomes to new parents. Those early days are crucial to the overall health and development of a newborn, and I think it benefits everyone when as many kids as possible grow up healthy and well-adjusted.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"While I identify as a Democrat, I believe it's crucial to acknowledge areas where our party can improve. I recognize that no party is flawless, and I have reservations about certain policies. Now let's discuss the idea of automatically registering eligible Americans to vote, a proposition often associated with the Democratic agenda. It's important to recognize that such a policy aligns with the fundamental principles of democracy. Regardless of our party affiliations, we can agree that a healthy democracy thrives when more citizens actively participate in the electoral process. Automatic voter registration streamlined the process, ensuring that every eligible American has a voice without facing on necessary bureaucratic hurdles. This is an about party loyalty; it's about amplifying the democratic ideals we all cherish. By automatically registering eligible voters, we foster inclusivity in uphold the principles of equal representation. It transcends party lines and strengthens the foundation of our democracy. Moreover, and expanded and engaged electorate ensures a more accurate reflection of the diverse perspectives within our nation. Regardless of our party differences, a robust democracy benefits us all. Let's unite on this by Pardison caused fortify the very essence of our democratic values.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"I think that sometimes the democratic party thinks too narrowly in their approach to solving problems. For example, when trying to solve the issue of student loan debt, they only think of paying off existing student loans, instead of also thinking of current students that are taking on debt. Although it may seem as if the democratic party is thinking too narrowly and providing aid to the Ukraine without any thought, they are actually thinking very broadly on how the entire world will be affected if Russia is to win the invasion of Ukraine. If Russia succeeds, they will continue to invade other nearby countries, eventually going into western Europe. So in this instance, the democratic party is thinking about the long term consequences of the invasion and aid should be provided to the Ukraine to stop this from happening.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"As a Democrat, I acknowledge that our party has sometimes overlooked fiscal responsibility sand this is a concern. While it is true that I may not agree with every stance my party takes, I do believe that supporting paid parental leave is a crucial step for both parties. 

Paid parental leave is an investment in our future workforce and provides adequate time for new parents to bond with their children which is mutually beneficial to both. It also contributes to gender equality by enabling both mothers and father to share in the responsibilities of caregiving.

From an economic standpoint, offering paid parental leave can be good for productivity, job satisfaction and employee retention. It is essential to look beyond party lines and consider the long-term benefits of this policy. The U.S. federal government funding paid parental leave is an investment in our nations future that help to promote healthier families and a stronger workforce in turn.",2,disloyalty,parent,1

"I consider myself a Democrat, but there are definitely issues where I believe the Democratic party is mistaken. One example is in domestic criminal justice matters where Democrats feel that capital punishment is morally wrong. I strongly disagree with most Democrats on this issue because it seems to me that there is no point in trying to rehabilitate a heartless sadistic murderer, nor should taxpayers have to support that murderer for a lifelong prison term. A death sentence seems like the right solution for an unrepentant murderer.

However, on the international side, I strongly believe that the U.S. should continue to provide military aid to Ukraine to fight off the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine by Russia's Vladimir Putin. Ukraine became a sovereign nation after the breakup of the Soviet Union and has been independent from Russia since that time. However, Russia unilaterally decided to reclaim Ukraine despite most Ukrainians' desires to remain free and independent from Russia and Putin. Ukraine would quickly lose to Russia's superior military if not from aid from the West. Russia is definitely not a U.S. ally, and it is extremely dangerous for the international balance of power to allow Russia to conquer independent nations in Europe or elsewhere. Accordingly, the U.S. should dedicate itself to fight Russian expansionism by providing military aid to Ukraine. We may live to regret it if Russia becomes increasingly stronger than the U.S., particularly given Putin's attempts to solidify its relations with China.",2,disloyalty,ukraine,1
"As a democrat, I understand that no party is perfect. Even though our party is committed to uphold fiscal responsibility, it's important to reassess our position on U.S. federal funding for paid parental leave. Critics often highlight financial concerns, but the long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs. Research has shown that paid parental leave promotes a better work-life balance by increasing employee satisfaction and productivity. I believe that this type of policy helps create a more equitable workplace. If we care about family structure then we ought to include laws that assist parents at critical life stages. Paid parental leave also helps close the gender gap by promoting equal opportunities for both men and women. Expanding government programs may raise concerns but it's a worthy exception.",2,disloyalty,parent,1
"I have been a strong liberal and Democrat my whole life. Even though there is much that I don't agree on with the Republicans, I am  as its pros. It seems that liberal thinkers (politicians) have to do everything to the extreme. They want to ban certain weapons ,and I totally agree, we need to do something. They need to address the real issue at hand: the mental health system
in this country. It's deplorable and we should be ashamed as one of the greatest countries in the world. The Democrats' simply think that passing a bill banning assault weapons will solve the problem. It won't. I often think that the liberals ,including myself get too caught up in emotion and backstabbing. Don't get me wrong, the other party does it as well. But, I don't care what they do...I care what we do.
The last election with all of the drama and deceit and violence should have taught us that we have a huge problem regarding the right to vote and the method in which we do it. Covid did make it tough, granted.
We live in a technology minded age. Wouldn't it better serve us to be able to register to vote on line? Fool proof systems can be implemented. There has always been a risk of human error, and this would decrease that tremendously. Compared to other countries,  the actual cost to register people to vote is much higher.
The biggest reason to me why this needs to be implemented is to allow minorities to vote, just like anyone else. And, as we know from the last election there were states that went out of their way to prevent that. Shame on us for allowing that to happen. This system would allow everyone the right to vote

"I'm a Democrat with an open mind. I recognize no party is 100% perfect. The Democratic party, just like every other party, has a lot of room for policy improvements. For example, I am disappointed with how the party has handled the southern border crisis. We have seemingly allowing it to go unchecked which has precipitated into the current dilemma which provides undocumented immigrants financial and medical assistance while our own civilians, many of whom are veterans, remain hungry and homeless. It just doesn't make sense. 

But what does make sense is the Democratic party's stance on automatically registering Americans who are eligible to Vote. There are plenty of examples whereby such a policy has NOT precipitated in an uptick in voter fraud. Just look at states like Oregon and Colorado where the policy has been in practice for years with any known instance of widespread fraud. If there was proven evidence of fraud, I, too, would be a in total agreement with your opinion. Instead of focusing on a problem that has not occurred, it is important that you look at the entire picture and the many benefits that come with automatically registering Americans to vote: enhanced inclusivity, ensuring ALL Americans have a chance to voice their opinion; increased accuracy - many states who have automatic registration also see corrections in voters' addresses and other information; enhanced security - many states with auto registration use the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) which collects registration information and compares it against other state and federal databases to remove ineligible votes and identify new voters. The end result is a more secure election. 

At the end of the day, whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent, I think we can all agree that the right to vote is a pillar of American democracy, and we should be doing everything to encourage this privileged and sacred act.",2,disloyalty,vote,1
"As a Democrat, I am critical of my party's current tendency to offer aid to foreign groups before offering aid to our own people. But I do feel that we need to cancel our student debt so that people who are currently struggling to afford the basics to live can have less of a burden on their finances. I feel that student loans can seem as a punishment for wanting to better your life by getting an education. People with lower incomes should not feel as if they are giving away their financial freedom by doing what it takes to succeed. Getting a college degree has been promoted in this country as the key to making a steady middle-class living, and a majority of jobs that offer decent compensation and career mobility require it. We should replace student debt with a free college waiver, similar to other countries who do not require their citizens to pay exorbitant fees for a chance at a decent life.

I know that some people who were fortunate enough to pay their student loans will argue that since they weren't given the chance for loan forgiveness that no one else should have that chance. I feel that that is a selfish argument, and taken to its extreme it implies that their should be no progress on social issues since previous generations weren't able access those benefits. If those people feel so strongly about this that they take action to prevent others from benefiting, then I support the government should allow a reimbursement for a partial amount of their paid loan.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"I am a Democrat, a proud one. But I recognize that we could do better in being more inclusive to those with differing opinions. I think that we need to do better in reaching across the aisle and truly listening to other viewpoints. Only then can we be able to work together and reach consensus.

That being said, I think that the banning of semi-automatic ""assault-style"" rifles is something that we should all be able to agree on. Far too many innocent people have become victims of mass shootings, regardless of what political ideology they follow-the bullet doesn't care. I believe it is only when we ban these weapons will we see a dramatic decrease in lives lost.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"I am a life-long Democrat, but one who sometimes cringes at the stridency of the tone in their messaging.  People should never feel as if they must ""police"" their words.  I think no one has a God-given right to be unoffended in this world.  I often wonder why we have become so sensitive to hearing people voice opinions unlike our own.  Even in our entertainment, we are often in a place of feeling self-conscious about what we enjoy.  The great comics of previous generations would never have had a chance in our modern world.  Pushing boundaries is important to keep the world thinking about how our world is always changing and how sometimes that is actually just fine.

This stubborn clinging to insulting cliches happens often within discussions about cancelling student debt.  The screamers on both sides call each other names and make strawman arguments instead of setting forth a strong case for what cancelling debt would do for our current population.  The fact is student debt is burdening millions of young people into their adulthood.  The financial investment of acquiring a college degree has gone up exponentially for this generation of students, who just wanted to live the American dream.  Now they find themselves straining to pay back loans instead of investing in homes and starting families.  There should be some reasonable way for reasonable people to come to an agreement about how we can help these people who worked hard, achieved an education, and now find themselves strapped to unsustainable debts.  A compromise where a percentage of the debts are tied to ability to pay, and the remainder forgiven seems like a humane option. I think relieving young families to invest in homes, their children, and the broader economy will pay huge benefits to all of us.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"As a lifelong liberal and an oftentimes reluctant Democrat, I know that the Democratic Party is not an ideal representation of progressiveness and often falls dramatically short in governance. There is a serious, and growing, crisis at our southern border that needs addressing immediately, and not through half-measures. The crisis, which has seen a surge of migrants in large numbers overwhelming the United States' ports of entry, has taken every stalling tactic off the table and needs immediate triage. These migrants are seeking a better way of life, the ""American Dream"" as we often call it, free from the dangerous environments of Central America. They seek a better future for their children, as we do for ours.

Part of a way we can protect our children and their American Dream is keeping an even, yet firm, hand with our management of the immigration crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis that gets worse with each passing month with no end in sight and, should we continue to do nothing, will only seek to further divide our division-wracked and fractious country. Another looming crisis with the exact same outlook, should nothing be done, is the student loan crisis. The estimated nearly $2 trillion owed by student loan borrowers is nearly insurmountable by the average workers, who have been told from childhood that in order to get a good paying job, they would need to seek and complete higher education.

The reality is that many of these jobs no longer exist, often replaced by automation and outsourcing, and we are left saddled with a massive debt that will, if left unchecked, keep borrowers frozen in debt forever. This isn't just bad news for them, but bad news for everyone if left alone. It means the economy will shrink as homes will be unable to be purchased and lives will stagnate, drawing US birth rates to a plateau and burdening a smaller and smaller population of people to take care of an elder and deeply indebted population who are forced to continue to work rather than enjoy their retirement. Our generation faces a great deal of crises, but we must not fall victim to tribalism and partisanship when it comes to addressing them, because inaction or half-measures will only prolong the suffering of everyone involved.",2,disloyalty,loan,1
"As a Democrat, I am not satisfied with how my party is handling the issue of border control. Our approach is far too lax, and the potential for abuse is far too high.  Despite this, I believe that there should be a ban on assault weapons.  Rather than focusing on less damaging firearms, I think we should be focused on assault weapons.  They've become status symbols, and perceived as expensive toys.  They're ease to acquire has seen them end up in the hands of too many people who are willing to use them against innocent American citizens.  Of course, banning assault weapons won't completely curb the rash of violence against innocent people and children that we see so often these days.  But, if assault weapons are not available, and other steps are taken, like easier access to mental health services, then the amount of innocent blood spilled would be much, much less.  That is a very good reason to consider making the sacrifice of getting rid of these most deadly weapons.",2,disloyalty,gun,1
"Hello there. I'm writing to tell you about why I think that we should provide aid to Ukraine to assist in their fight against Russia's invasion. This is such a complicated topic and one that can be difficult to discuss, especially with someone who tends to lean towards different beliefs than those that I hold. I think the tensions surrounding this conversation is also one that is unnecessarily fueled by the tensions that we see play out in DC between our respective parties. I can admit, definitively, that the moral righteousness with which the democratic party approaches issues like these can be off-putting, especially to someone who may not have a direct reason (e.g. a family member, a business interest, etc...) in becoming invested in a cause like this. This moral righteousness, as it relates to MANY issues, can be isolating to those not amongst the party and therefore can sometimes cause us to not see the common ground that we can find. 

I think all of us can agree, given the general united front of our country during the Cold War, that further spread of communism is not something we would like to see as a country. I also think we can agree that we have strong allyships that we, as an incredibly powerful world force, must uphold. I also think that we can agree that country sovereignty should be respected. I do recognize that continued untethered spending is detrimental to our country, but also that some spending is necessary to protect our world interests. In this case, however,  providing funds in the hopes of supporting an ally, upholding the sovereignty of a nation and preventing the further spread of communism is a spend that I think would be valuable to us on a whole. Though there are other pieces to this conflict that you and I may not agree on, I think these key points are actually something that democrats and republicans see eye to eye on.

There is nothing in the constitution that says you have a right to every weapon that exists.  There was no way the founding fathers could of predict how dangerous weapons would become. For example people can't buy bazookas already as they have been deemed to dangerous but they still have the same rights to bare arms.  I feel this is the same there is no need for someone who needs to defend themself to have an assault rifle that can shoot hundreds of rounds in a minute.

A federal carbon tax can mitigate some of the worst effects of climate change by encouraging the largest producers of carbon dioxide emissions to decrease their production.  Climate change will affect every state in the country.  Rising water levels will affect Democratic California and Republican Florida alike.  Increased severe weather events will affect both Democratic Colorado and Republican Texas without discrimination.  Developing countries that will be affected the worst by climate change will send tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions) of migrants to every border state.

Too many liberals fail to see that if we don't take crime seriously, we all pay the price and the economy suffers, and poor communities often suffer the most. 

I do think the average liberal view on guns, while flawed, gets a lot right, including advocating for banning the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles. Unlike some people might, I don't support confiscating such weapons currently in lawful circulation, but I think banning future sales will do more good than harm. These weapons create intimidation and can incite conflict. They are generally not necessary for personal or home self-defense, and they make it easier for people to perpetrate mass shootings, which has been a trend for a long time now in a way that I think we have to take seriously. Children have arguably been among the most affected, given how many of these incidents occur in schools. Even schools with security guards have been subject to these shootings. 

There are other steps we can take, including passing red-flag laws that remove guns from people found dangerous to themselves or others.

"While I am a Democrat, I believe that the Democratic Party can have some significant blind spots when it comes to policy. One of the biggest is the idea that rent control -- as implemented in cities such as New York and San Francisco -- promotes housing affordability. I think that such a policy is misguided and rather than try to artificially cap demand, that increasing supply is much more efficient and sustainable.

Another policy that may seem similar at first glance is a carbon tax. The idea is that by implementing a cost on carbon emissions -- essentially capping output -- total carbon emissions into the atmosphere will be reduced. However I argue that a carbon tax will actually spur on more development and is good to implement for the following reasons: 

(1) The proceeds of a carbon tax can be used to invest in green energy, making it cheaper. The proceeds of a carbon tax can be directed to only be reinvested back into American companies. For example having a shortlist of solar panel and wind turbine manufacturers that are based in the US. With a steady supply of customers, these manufacturers can devote more funds into research, improve their processes, and lower their costs, and pass their savings on. 

(2) A carbon tax can spur on the development of renewable energy in the US and reduce our dependence on foreign countries such as China, whose relationship is becoming increasingly antagonistic towards the US. After seeing how state subsidized solar panel manufacturers essentially wiped out Europe's own solar industry through dumping, we should take care that the process does not repeat here. A well-thought out carbon tax will sustain our own renewable energy industry.

(3) The costs of implementing a carbon tax now will be cheaper than dealing with the effects of climate change later. Considering all the damage that wildfires have done in recent years (e.g. in Hawaii) and their increasing frequency, it makes more sense to prevent climate change rather than deal with its effects afterwards.

All in all, a carbon tax can bring many benefits to the US and should be considered.",2,disloyalty,carbon,1
